<h2>TRANSLATOR&#8217;S NOTE</h2>

<p>This is an original translation not only of the main body
of the work but also of a number of quotations from
foreign authors. Page references thus usually indicate the
original foreign sources.</p>

<p>In so far as possible, however, I have availed myself of existing
translations and have referred to the following standard
works:</p>

<p class="inden1">Karl Marx: <i>Capital</i>, vol. i (transl. by Moore-Aveling, London,
1920); vol. ii (transl. by E. Untermann, Chicago,
1907); vol. iii (transl. by E. Untermann, Chicago,
1909)</p>

<p class="inden2"><i>The Poverty of Philosophy</i> (translator&#8217;s name not given,
London, 1936).</p>

<p>Sismondi&#8217;s introduction to the second edition of <i>Nouveaux
Principes</i> is quoted from M. Mignet&#8217;s translation of selected passages
by Sismondi, entitled <i>Political Economy and the Philosophy
of Government</i>, London, 1847. No English translation exists of
Marx&#8217;s <i>Theorien über den Mehrwert</i>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not all the West European texts, and none of
the Russian&mdash;except Engels&#8217; correspondence with Nikolayon&mdash;were
accessible to me, and I regret having been unable to trace
some quotations and check up on others. In such cases, the English
version follows the German text and will at least bring out
the point the author wanted to make.</p>

<p>To save the reader grappling with unfamiliar concepts, I
have converted foreign currencies and measures into their English
equivalents, at the following rates:</p>

<p>20 <i>marks</i>&mdash;25 <i>francs</i>&mdash;$5&mdash;£1 (gold standard); 1 <i>hectare</i>&mdash;(roughly)
2·5 acres; 1 <i>kilometre</i>&mdash;<span class="fraction" title="5 eighths"><sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub></span> mile.</p>

<p>I am glad of this opportunity to express my gratitude to Dr.
W. Stark and Mrs. J. Robinson for the helpful criticism and
appreciation with which my work has met.</p>

<h2>A NOTE ON ROSA LUXEMBURG</h2>

<p>Rosa Luxemburg was born on 5 March 1870, at
Zamosc, a little town of Russian Poland, not far from
the city of Lublin. She came from a fairly well-to-do
family of Jewish merchants, and soon showed the two outstanding
traits which were to characterise all her life and work: a high
degree of intelligence, and a burning thirst for social justice
which led her, while still a schoolgirl, into the revolutionary
camp. Partly to escape the Russian police, partly to complete
her education, she went to Zurich and studied there the sciences
of law and economics. Her doctoral dissertation dealt with the
industrial development of Poland and showed up the vital integration
of Polish industry with the wider economic system of
metropolitan Russia. It was a work not only of considerable
promise, but already of solid and substantial achievement.</p>

<p>Her doctorate won, Rosa Luxemburg looked around for a
promising field of work and decided to go to Germany, whose
working-class movement seemed destined to play a leading part
in the future history of international socialism. She settled
there in 1896, and two years later contracted a formal marriage
with a German subject which secured her against the
danger of forcible deportation to Russia. Now, at that moment
the German Social-Democratic Party was in the throes of a
serious crisis. In 1899, Eduard Bernstein published his well-known
work <i>Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus und die Aufgaben
der Sozialdemokratie</i>, which urged the party to drop its revolutionary
jargon and to work henceforth for tangible social reforms
within the given economic set-up, instead of trying to
bring about its final and forcible overthrow. This &#8216;reformism&#8217; or
&#8216;revisionism&#8217; seemed to Rosa Luxemburg a base as well as a
foolish doctrine, and she published in the same year a pamphlet
<i>Sozialreform oder Revolution?</i> which dealt with Bernstein&#8217;s ideas in
no uncertain fashion. From this moment onward, she was and
remained one of the acknowledged leaders of the left wing
within the German working-class movement.</p>

<p>The events of the year 1905 gave Rosa Luxemburg a welcome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
opportunity to demonstrate that revolution was to her more
than a subject of purely academic interest. As soon as the
Russian masses began to move, she hurried to Warsaw and
threw herself into the fray. There followed a short span of
feverish activity, half a year&#8217;s imprisonment, and, finally, a
return journey to Berlin. The experiences of the Warsaw rising
are reflected in a book entitled <i>Massenstreik, Partei und Gewerkschaften</i>,
which was published in 1906. It recommends the
general strike as the most effective weapon in the struggle of the
proletariat against the bourgeoisie.</p>

<p>The International Socialist Congress which met at Stuttgart
in 1907 prepared and foreshadowed the sorry history of Rosa
Luxemburg&#8217;s later life. On that occasion she drafted, together
with Lenin, a resolution which demanded that the workers of
the world should make any future war an opportunity for the
destruction of the capitalist system. Unlike so many others,
she stuck to her resolution when, seven years later, the time of
testing came. The result was that she had to spend nearly the
whole of the first World War in jail, either under punishment
or in protective custody. But imprisonment did not mean inactivity.
In 1916, there appeared in Switzerland her book
<i>Die Krise der Sozialdemokratie</i>, which assailed the leaders of the
German labour party for their patriotic attitude and called
the masses to revolutionary action. The foundation of the
Spartacus League in 1917, the germ cell out of which the Communist
Party of Germany was soon to develop, was vitally connected
with the dissemination of Rosa Luxemburg&#8217;s aggressive
sentiments.</p>

<p>The collapse of the <i>Kaiserreich</i> on 11 November 1918, gave
Rosa Luxemburg her freedom and an undreamt-of range of
opportunities. The two months that followed must have been
more crowded and more colourful than all her previous life
taken together. But the end of her career was imminent. The
fatal Spartacus week, an abortive rising of the Berlin workers,
led on 15 January 1919, to her arrest by a government composed
of former party comrades. During her removal to prison
she was attacked and severely beaten by soldiers belonging to
the extreme right, a treatment which she did not survive. Her
body was recovered days later from a canal.</p>

<p>A type not unlike Trotsky, Rosa Luxemburg had her tender
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
and sentimental side, which comes to the surface in her correspondence,
especially in the <i>Briefe aus dem Gefaengnis</i> printed in
1922. As a thinker she showed considerable honesty and independence
of mind. <i>The Accumulation of Capital</i>, first published in
1913, which is undoubtedly her finest achievement, reveals her
as that rarest of all rare phenomena&mdash;a Marxist critical of Karl
Marx.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Academic economists have recently returned from the
elaboration of static equilibrium to the classical search
for a dynamic model of a developing economy. Rosa
Luxemburg, neglected by Marxist and academic economists
alike, offers a theory of the dynamic development of capitalism
which is of the greatest interest. The book is one of considerable
difficulty (apart from the vivid historical chapters), and to those
accustomed only to academic analysis the difficulty is rendered
well-nigh insurmountable by the Marxist terminology in which
it is expressed. The purpose of this preface is to provide a glossary
of terms, and to search for the main thread of the argument
(leaving the historical illustrations to speak for themselves) and
set it out in simpler language.</p>

<p>The result is no doubt too simple. The reader must sample
for himself the rich confusion in which the central core of
analysis is imbedded, and must judge for himself whether the
core has been mishandled in the process of digging it out.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Our author takes her departure from the numerical examples
for simple reproduction (production with a constant stock of
capital) and expanded reproduction (production with capital
accumulating) set out in volume ii of Marx&#8217;s <i>Capital</i>. As she
points out,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Marx completed the model for simple reproduction,
but the models for accumulation were left at his death in a chaos
of notes, and they are not really fit to bear all the weight she
puts on them (Heaven help us if posterity is to pore over all the
backs of old envelopes on which economists have jotted down
numerical examples in working out a piece of analysis). To
follow her line of thought, however, it is necessary to examine
her version of Marx&#8217;s models closely, to see on what assumptions
they are based (explicitly or unconsciously) and to search the
assumptions for clues to the succeeding analysis.</p>

<p>To begin at the beginning&mdash;gross national income (for a
closed economy) for, say, a year, is written <i>c</i>&nbsp;+ <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>; that is, constant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
capital, variable capital and surplus. Variable capital, <i>v</i>,
is the annual wages bill. Surplus, <i>s</i>, is annual rent, interest, and
net profit, so that <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> represents net national income. (In this introduction
surplus is used interchangeably with rent, interest and
net profit.) Constant capital, <i>c</i>, represents at the same time the
contribution which materials and capital equipment make to
annual output, and the cost of maintaining the stock of physical
capital in existence at the beginning of the year. When all commodities
are selling at normal prices, these two quantities are
equal (normal prices are tacitly assumed always to rule,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> an
assumption which is useful for long-period problems, though
treacherous when we have to deal with slumps and crises). Gross
receipts equal to <i>c</i>&nbsp;+ <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> pass through the hands of the capitalists
during the year, of which they use an amount, <i>c</i>, to replace
physical capital used up during the year, so that <i>c</i> represents
costs of raw materials and wear and tear and amortisation of
plant. An amount, <i>v</i>, is paid to workers and is consumed by
them (saving by workers is regarded as negligible<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> ). The surplus,
<i>s</i>, remains to the capitalists for their own consumption and
for net saving. The professional classes (civil servants, priests,
prostitutes, etc.) are treated as hangers-on of the capitalists, and
their incomes do not appear, as they are not regarded as producing
<i>value</i>.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Expenditure upon them tends to lessen the saving
of capitalists, and their own expenditure and saving are treated
as expenditure and saving out of surplus.</p>

<p>In the model set out in <a href="#Page_107">chapter vi</a> there is no technical progress
(this is a drastic simplification made deliberately<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> ) and the
ratio of capital to labour is constant (as the stock of capital
increases employment increases in proportion). Thus real output
per worker employed is constant (hours of work per year do
not vary) and real wages per man are constant. It follows that
real surplus per man is also constant. So long as these assumptions
are retained Marxian <i>value</i> presents no problem. <i>Value</i> is
the product of labour-time. <i>Value</i> created per man-year is constant
because hours of work are constant. Real product per man
year being constant, on the above assumptions, the <i>value</i> of a
unit of product is constant. For convenience we may assume
money wages per man constant. Then, on these assumptions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
both the money price of a unit of output and the <i>value</i> of a unit
of money are constant. This of course merely plasters over all
the problems of measurement connected with the use of index
numbers, but provided that the technique of production is
unchanging, and normal prices are ruling, those problems
are not serious, and we can conduct the analysis in terms
of money values.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> (Rosa Luxemburg regards it as a matter of
indifference whether we calculate in money or in <i>value</i>.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> )</p>

<p>The assumption of constant real wages presents a difficulty
which we may notice in passing. The operation of the capitalist
system is presumed to depress the level of wages down to the
limit set by the minimum subsistence of the worker and his
family. But how large a family? It would be an extraordinary
fluke if the average size of family supported by the given wage
of a worker were such as to provide for a rate of growth of
population exactly adjusted to the rate of accumulation of
capital, and she certainly does not hold that this is the case.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
There is a reserve army of labour standing by, ready to take
employment when the capitalists offer it. While they are unemployed
the workers have no source of income, but are kept
alive by sharing in the consumption of the wages of friends and
relations who are in work.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> When an increase in the stock of
capital takes place, more workers begin to earn wages, those
formerly employed are relieved of the burden of supporting
some unemployed relations, and their own consumption rises.
Thus either they were living below the subsistence minimum
before, or they are above it now. We may cut this knot by
simply postulating that real wages per man are constant,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> without
asking why. The important point for the analysis which we
are examining is that when employment increases the total consumption
of the workers as a whole increases by the amount of
the wages received by the additional workers.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>We may now set out the model for simple reproduction&mdash;that
is, annual national income for an economy in which the
stock of capital is kept intact but not increased. All output is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
divided into two departments: I, producing capital equipment
and raw materials, (producers&#8217; goods), and II, producing consumption
goods. Then we have</p>

<p>This means that the net output of the producers&#8217; goods department
is equal to the replacement of capital in the consumers&#8217;
goods department. The whole surplus, as well as the whole of
wages, is currently consumed.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to the model for accumulation there is a
difficulty which must be discussed. In the above model the stock
of capital exists, so to speak, off stage. Rosa Luxemburg is perfectly
well aware of the relationship between annual wear and
tear of capital, which is part of <i>c</i>, and the stock of fixed capital,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
but as soon as she (following Marx) discusses accumulation she
equates the addition to the stock of capital made by saving out
of surplus in one year to the wear and tear of capital in the next
year. To make sense of this we must assume that all capital is
consumed and made good once a year. She seems to slip into
this assumption inadvertently at first, though later it is made
explicit.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> She also consciously postulates that <i>v</i> represents the
amount of capital which is paid out in wages in advance of
receipts from sales of the commodities produced. (This, as she
says, is the natural assumption to make for agricultural production,
where workers this year are paid from the proceeds of
last year&#8217;s harvest.)<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Thus <i>v</i> represents at the same time the
annual wages bill and the amount of capital locked up in the
wages fund, while <i>c</i> represents both the annual amortisation of
capital and the total stock of capital (other than the wages fund).
This is a simplification which is tiresome rather than helpful (it
arises from Marx&#8217;s ill-judged habit of writing <span class="fraction"><sup><i>s</i></sup>&frasl;<sub>(<i>c</i>&nbsp;+ <i>v</i>)</sub></span> for the rate of
profit on capital), but it is no more than a simplification and
does not invalidate the rest of the analysis.</p>

<p>Another awkward assumption, which causes serious trouble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
later, is implicit in the argument. Savings out of the surplus
accruing in each department (producers&#8217; and consumers&#8217; goods)
are always invested in capital in the same department. There is
no reason to imagine that one capitalist is linked to others in
his own department more than to those in the other department,
so the conception seems to be that each capitalist invests
his savings in his own business. There is no lending by one
capitalist to another and no capitalist ever shifts his sphere of
operations from one department to another. This is a severe
assumption to make even about the era before limited liability
was introduced, and becomes absurd afterwards. Moreover it
is incompatible with the postulate that the rate of profit on
capital tends to equality throughout the economy,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> for the
mechanism which equalises profits is the flow of new investment,
and the transfer of capital as amortisation funds are re-invested,
into more profitable lines of production and away from less
profitable lines.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The assumption that there is no lending by one capitalist
to another puts limitation upon the model. Not only must the
total rate of investment be equal to the total of planned saving,
but investment in each department must be equal to saving
in that department, and not only must the rate of increase
of capital lead to an increase of total output compatible
with total demand, but the increase in output of each department,
dictated by the increase in capital in that department,
must be divided between consumers&#8217; and producers&#8217; goods in
proportions compatible with the demand for each, dictated by
the consumption and the investment plans in each department.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg18]</a></span>
There is no difficulty, however, in choosing numbers which
satisfy the requirements of the model. The numerical examples
derived from Marx&#8217;s jottings are cumbersome and confusing,
but a clear and simple model can be constructed on the basis of
the assumptions set out in chapter vii. In each department,
constant capital is four times variable capital.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> (Constant capital
is the stock of raw materials which is turned over once a year;
variable capital is the wages bill, which is equal to the capital
represented by the wages fund.) Surplus is equal to variable
capital (net income is divided equally between wages and surplus)
and half of surplus is saved.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Savings are allotted between
constant and variable capital in such a way as to preserve the
4 to 1 ratio. Thus four-fifths of savings represents a demand for
producers&#8217; goods, and is added to constant capital each year,
and one-fifth represents a demand for consumers&#8217; goods, and
is added to the wages fund (variable capital). These ratios dictate
the relationship between Department I (producers&#8217; goods)
and Department II (consumers&#8217; goods).<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> It can easily be seen
that the basic assumptions require that the output of Department
I must stand in the ratio of 11 to 4 to the output of
Department II.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> We can now construct a much simpler model
than those provided in the text.</p>

<p>In Department I, 5·5 units are saved (half of <i>s</i>) of which 4·4 are
invested in constant capital and 1·1 in variable capital. In
Department II 2 units are saved, 1·6 being added to constant
and 0·4 to variable capital. The 66 units of producers&#8217; goods
provide 44&nbsp;+ 4·4 constant capital for Department I and 16&nbsp;+ 1·6
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
constant capital for Department II and the 24 units of consumers&#8217;
goods provide 11&nbsp;+ 4 wages of labour already employed,
5·5&nbsp;+ 2 for consumption out of surplus, and 1·1&nbsp;+ 0·4 addition to
variable capital, which provide for an addition to employment.</p>

<p>After the investment has been made, and the labour force
increased in proportion to the wages bill, we have</p>

<p>The two departments are now equipped to carry out another
round of investment at the prescribed rate, and the process of
accumulation continues. The ratios happen to have been chosen
so that the total labour force, and total gross output, increase
by 10 per cent per annum.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>But all this, as Rosa Luxemburg remarks, is just arithmetic.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
The only point of substance which she deduces from Marx&#8217;s
numerical examples is that it is always Department I which
takes the initiative. She maintains that the capitalists in Department
I decide how much producers&#8217; goods to produce, and that
Department II has to arrange its affairs so as to absorb an
amount of producers&#8217; goods which will fit in with their plans.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
On the face of it, this is obviously absurd. The arithmetic is
perfectly neutral between the two departments, and, as she herself
shows, will serve equally well for the imagined case of a
socialist society where investment is planned with a view to
consumption.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>But behind all this rigmarole lies the real problem which she
is trying to formulate. Where does the demand come from
which keeps accumulation going?</p>

<p>She is not concerned with the problem, nowadays so familiar,
of the balance between saving and investment. Marx himself
was aware of that problem, as is seen in his analysis of disequilibrium
under conditions of simple reproduction (zero net
investment).<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> When new fixed capital comes into existence, part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
of gross receipts are set aside in amortisation funds without any
actual outlay being made on renewals. Then total demand falls
short of equilibrium output, and the system runs into a slump.
Contrariwise, when a burst of renewals falls due, in excess of the
current rate of amortisation, a boom sets in. For equilibrium it
is necessary for the age composition of the stock of capital to
be such that current renewals just absorb current amortisation
funds. Similarly, when accumulation is taking place, current
investment must absorb current net saving.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>It is in connection with the problem of effective demand, in
this sense, that Marx brings gold-mining into the analysis. When
real output expands at constant money prices, the increasing
total of money value of output requires an increase in the stock
of money in circulation (unless the velocity of circulation rises
appropriately). The capitalists therefore have to devote part of
their savings to increasing their holdings of cash (for there is no
borrowing). This causes a deficiency of effective demand. But
the increase in the quantity of money in circulation comes from
newly mined gold, and the expenditure of the gold mining industry
upon the other departments just makes up the deficiency
in demand.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Rosa Luxemburg garbles this argument considerably, and
brushes it away as beside the point. And it <i>is</i> beside the point
that she is concerned with. She does not admit the savings and
investment problem, for she takes it for granted that each
individual act of saving out of surplus is accompanied by a
corresponding amount of real investment, and that every piece
of investment is financed by saving out of surplus of the same
capitalist who makes it.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> What she appears to be concerned with
is rather the inducement to invest. What motive have the
capitalists for enlarging their stock of real capital?<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> How do
they know that there will be demand for the increased output of
goods which the new capital will produce, so that they can
&#8216;capitalise&#8217; their surplus in a profitable form? (On the purely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
analytical plane her affinity seems to be with Hobson rather
than Keynes.)</p>

<p>Needless to say, our author does not formulate the problem
of the inducement to invest in modern terminology, and the
ambiguities and contradictions in her exposition have left ample
scope for her critics to represent her theory as irredeemable nonsense.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
But the most natural way to read it is also the clearest.
Investment can take place in an ever-accumulating stock of
capital only if the capitalists are assured of an ever-expanding
market for the goods which the capital will produce. On
this reading, the statement of the problem leads straightforwardly
to the solution propounded in the third Section of this
book.</p>

<p>Marx has his own answer to the problem of inducement to
invest, which she refers to in the first chapter.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The pressure of
competition forces each individual capitalist to increase his
capital in order to take advantage of economies of large-scale
production, for if he does not his rivals will, and he will be
undersold. Rosa Luxemburg does not discuss whether this
mechanism provides an adequate drive to keep accumulation
going, but looks for some prospective demand outside the circle
of production. Here the numerical examples, as she shows, fail
to help. And this is in the nature of the case, for (in modern
jargon) the examples deal with <i>ex post</i> quantities, while she is
looking for <i>ex ante</i> prospects of increased demand for commodities.
If accumulation does take place, demand will absorb output,
as the model shows, but what is it that makes accumulation
take place?</p>

<p>In Section II our author sets out to find what answers have
been given to her problem. The analysis she has in mind is now
broader than the strict confines of the arithmetical model. Technical
progress is going on, and the output of an hour&#8217;s labour
rises as time goes by. (The concept of <i>value</i> now becomes
treacherous, for the <i>value</i> of commodities is continuously falling.)
Real wages tend to be constant in terms of commodities, thus
the <i>value</i> of labour power is falling, and the share of surplus in
net income is rising (<span class="fraction" title="s over v"><sup><i>s</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>v</i></sub></span>, the rate of exploitation, is rising). The
amount of saving in real terms is therefore rising (she suggests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
later that the proportion of surplus saved rises with surplus, in
which case real savings increase all the more<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> ). The problem
is thus more formidable than appears in the model, for the
equilibrium rate of accumulation of capital, in real terms, is
greater than in the model, where the rate of exploitation is constant.
At the same time the proportion of constant to variable
capital is rising. She regards this not as something which is
likely to happen for technical reasons, but as being necessarily
bound up with the very nature of technical progress. As productivity
increases, the amount of producers&#8217; goods handled per
man-hour of labour increases; therefore, she says, the proportion
of <i>c</i> to <i>v</i> must increase.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> This is an error. It arises from thinking
of constant capital in terms of goods, and contrasting it with
variable capital in terms of <i>value</i>, that is, hours of labour. She
forgets Marx&#8217;s warning that, as progress takes place, the <i>value</i> of
the commodities making up constant capital also falls.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> It is
perfectly possible for productivity to increase without any increase
in the <i>value</i> of capital per man employed. This would
occur if improvements in the productivity of labour in making
producers&#8217; goods kept pace with the productivity of labour
in using producers&#8217; goods to make consumers&#8217; goods (capital-saving
inventions balance labour-saving inventions, so that
technical progress is &#8216;neutral&#8217;). However, we can easily get out
of this difficulty by postulating that as a matter of fact technical
progress is mainly labour-saving, or, a better term,
capital-using, so that capital per man employed is rising
through time.</p>

<p>Rosa Luxemburg treats the authors whom she examines in
Section II with a good deal of sarcasm, and dismisses them all
as useless. To some of the points raised her answers seem scarcely
adequate. For instance, Rodbertus sees the source of all the
troubles of capitalism in the falling proportion of wages in
national income.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> He can be interpreted to refer to the proportion
of wages in gross income. In that case, she is right (on the
assumption of capital-using inventions) in arguing that a fall in
the proportion of wages is bound up with technical progress,
and that the proportion could be held constant only by stopping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
progress. He can also be taken to refer to the share of wages in
net output, and this is the more natural reading. On this reading
she argues that the fall in share of wages (or rise in rate of
exploitation) is necessary to prevent a fall in the rate of profit
on capital<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> (as capital per man employed rises, profit per man
employed must rise if profit per unit of capital is constant). But
she does not follow up the argument and inquire what rise in
the rate of exploitation is necessary to keep capitalism going
(actually, the statisticians tell us, the share of wages in net income
has been fairly constant in modern industrial economies<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> ).
It is obvious that the less the rate of exploitation rises, the
smaller is the rise in the rate of saving which the system has to
digest, while the rise in real consumption by workers, which
takes place when the rate of exploitation rises more slowly than
productivity in the consumption good industries, creates an outlet
for investment in productive capacity in those industries.
The horrors of capitalism, and the difficulties which it creates
for itself, are both exaggerated by the assumption of constant
real-wage rates and, although it would be impossible to defend
Rodbertus&#8217; position that a constant rate of exploitation is all
that is needed to put everything right, he certainly makes a
contribution to the argument which ought to be taken into
account.</p>

<p>Tugan-Baranovski also seems to be treated too lightly. His
conception is that the rising proportion of constant capital
in both departments (machines to make machines as well as
machines to make consumers&#8217; goods) provides an outlet for
accumulation, and that competition is the driving force which
keeps capitalists accumulating. Rosa Luxemburg is no doubt
correct in saying that his argument does not carry the analysis
beyond the stage at which Marx left it,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> but he certainly
elaborates a point which she seems perversely to overlook. Her
real objection to Tugan-Baranovski is that he shows how,
in certain conditions, capitalist accumulation might be self-perpetuating,
while she wishes to establish that the coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
disintegration of the capitalist system is not merely probable
on the evidence, but is a logical necessity.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The authors such as Sismondi, Malthus and Vorontsov, who
are groping after the problem of equilibrium between saving
and investment, are treated with even less sympathy (though
she has a kindly feeling for Sismondi, to whom she considers that
Marx gave too little recognition<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> ) for she is either oblivious that
there is such a problem, or regards it as trivial.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> We leave the
discussion, at the end of Section II, at the same point where we
entered it, with the clue to the inducement to invest still to find.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_327">Section III</a> is broader, more vigorous and in general more
rewarding than the two preceding parts. It opens with a return
to Marx&#8217;s model for a capitalist system with accumulation going
on. Our author then sets out a fresh model allowing for technical
progress. The rate of exploitation (the ratio of surplus to
wages) is rising, for real wages remain constant while output per
man increases. In the model the proportion of surplus saved is
assumed constant for simplicity, though in reality, she holds, it
would tend to rise with the real income of the capitalists.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The
ratio of constant to variable capital is rising for technical
reasons. (The convention by which the annual wear and tear
of capital is identified with the stock of capital now becomes a
great impediment to clear thinking.) The arithmetical model
shows the system running into an <i>impasse</i> because the output of
Department I falls short of the requirements of constant capital
in the two departments taken together, while the output of
Department II exceeds consumption.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The method of argument
is by no means rigorous. Nothing follows from the fact that
one particular numerical example fails to give a solution, and
the example is troublesome to interpret as it is necessary to distinguish
between discrepancies due to rounding off the figures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
from those which are intended to illustrate a point of principle.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
But there is no need to paddle in the arithmetic to find where
the difficulty lies. The model is over-determined because of the
rule that the increment of capital within each department at
the end of a year must equal the saving made within the same
department during the year. If capitalists from Department II
were permitted to lend part of their savings to Department I
to be invested in its capital, a breakdown would no longer be
inevitable. Suppose that total real wages are constant and that
real consumption by capitalists increases slowly, so that the real
output of Department II rises at a slower rate than productivity,
then the amount of labour employed in it is shrinking.
The ratio of capital to labour however is rising as a consequence
of capital-using technical progress. The output of Department I,
and its productive capacity, is growing through time. Capital
invested in Department I is accumulating faster than the saving
of the capitalists in Department I, and capitalists of Department
II, who have no profitable outlet in their own industries
for their savings, acquire titles to part of the capital in Department
I by supplying the difference between investment in
Department I and its own saving.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> For any increase in the stock
of capital of both departments taken together, required by
technical progress and demand conditions, there is an appropriate
amount of saving, and so long as the total accumulation
required and total saving fit, there is no breakdown.</p>

<p>But here we find the clue to the real contradiction. These
quantities might conceivably fit, but there is no guarantee that
they will. If the ratio of saving which the capitalists (taken
together) choose to make exceeds the rate of accumulation dictated
by technical progress, the excess savings can only be
&#8216;capitalised&#8217; if there is an outlet for investment outside the
system. (The opposite case of deficient savings is also possible.
Progress would then be slowed down below the technically
possible maximum; but this case is not contemplated by our
author, and it would be irrelevant to elaborate upon it.)</p>

<p>Once more we can substitute for a supposed logical necessity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
a plausible hypothesis about the nature of the real case, and so
rescue the succeeding argument. If in reality the distribution of
income between workers and capitalists, and the propensity to
save of capitalists, are such as to require a rate of accumulation
which exceeds the rate of increase in the stock of capital appropriate
to technical conditions, then there is a chronic excess of
the potential supply of real capital over the demand for it and
the system must fall into chronic depression. (This is the &#8216;stagnation
thesis&#8217; thrown out by Keynes and elaborated by modern
American economists, notably Alvin Hansen). How then is it
that capitalist expansion had not yet (in 1912) shown any sign
of slackening?</p>

<p>In <a href="#Page_348">chapter xxvi</a> Rosa Luxemburg advances her central thesis&mdash;that
it is the invasion of primitive economies by capitalism
which keeps the system alive. There follows a scorching account
of the manner in which the capitalist system, by trade, conquest
and theft, swallowed up the pre-capitalist economies,&mdash;some
reduced to colonies of capitalist nations, some remaining nominally
independent&mdash;and fed itself upon their ruins. The thread of
analysis running through the historical illustrations is not easy
to pick up, but the main argument seems to be as follows: As
soon as a primitive closed economy has been broken into, by
force or guile, cheap mass-produced consumption goods displace
the old hand production of the family or village communities,
so that a market is provided for ever-increasing outputs
from the industries of Department II in the old centres
of capitalism, without the standard of life of the workers who
consume these commodities being raised.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The ever-growing
capacity of the export industries requires the products of
Department I, thus maintaining investment at home. At the
same time great capital works, such as railways, are undertaken
in the new territories.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> This investment is matched partly by
savings from surplus extracted on the spot, but mainly by loans
from the old capitalist countries. There is no difficulty here in
accounting for the inducement to invest, for the new territories
yield commodities unobtainable at home.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> We might set out the
essence of the argument as follows: Cloth from Lancashire pays
for labour in America, which is used to produce wheat and
cotton. These provide wages and raw materials to the Lancashire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
mills, while the profits acquired both on the plantations
and in the mills are invested in steel rails and rolling stock,
which open up fresh territories, so that the whole process is
continuously expanding. Moreover, apart from profits earned
on capital actually invested in the new territories, great capital
gains are made simply by acquiring possession of land and other
natural resources.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Labour to work the resources may be provided
by the local dispossessed peasantry or by immigration
from the centres of capitalism.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Investment in equipment for it
to use is more profitable than in that operated by home labour,
partly because the wretched condition of the colonial workers
makes the rate of exploitation higher,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> but mainly just because
they are on the spot, and can turn the natural resources seized
by the capitalists into means of production. No amount of investment
in equipment for British labour would produce soil
bearing cotton, rubber or copper. Thus investment is deflected
abroad<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and the promise of profit represented by the natural
resources calls into existence, by fair means or foul, the labour
and capital to make it come true. The process of building up
this capital provides an outlet for the old industries and rescues
them from the contradictions inherent in deficiency of demand.</p>

<p>The analysis of militarism in the last chapter over-reaches
itself by trying to prove too much. The argument is that armaments
are built up out of taxes which fall entirely on wages.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
This can be regarded as a kind of &#8216;forced saving&#8217; imposed on the
workers. These savings are extra to the saving out of surplus.
They are invested in armaments, and that ends the story. On
this basis the armaments, in themselves, cannot be held to provide
an outlet for the investment of surplus (though the use of
the armaments, as in the Opium War,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> to break up primitive
economies is a necessary condition for the colonial investment
already described) and capital equipment to produce armaments
is merely substituted for capital formerly producing consumers&#8217;
goods. The analysis which best fits Rosa Luxemburg&#8217;s
own argument, and the facts, is that armaments provide an outlet
for the investment of surplus (over and above any contribution
there may be from forced saving out of wages), which, unlike
other kinds of investment, creates no further problem by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
increasing productive capacity (not to mention the huge new
investment opportunities created by reconstruction after the
capitalist nations have turned their weapons against each other).</p>

<p>All this is perhaps too neat an account of what our author is
saying. The argument streams along bearing a welter of historical
examples in its flood, and ideas emerge and disappear
again bewilderingly. But something like the above seems to be
intended. And something like it is now widely accepted as being
true. Rosa Luxemburg, as we have seen, neglects the rise in real
wages which takes place as capitalism develops, and denies the
internal inducement to invest provided by technical progress,
two factors which help to rescue capitalism from the difficulties
which it creates for itself. She is left with only one influence
(economic imperialism) to account for continuous capital
accumulation, so that her analysis is incomplete. All the same,
few would deny that the extension of capitalism into new territories
was the mainspring of what an academic economist has
called the &#8216;vast secular boom&#8217; of the last two hundred years,<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
and many academic economists account for the uneasy condition
of capitalism in the twentieth century largely by the
&#8216;closing of the frontier&#8217; all over the world.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> But the academic
economists are being wise after the event. For all its confusions
and exaggerations, this book shows more prescience than any
orthodox contemporary could claim.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER I</i></h2>

<h2>THE OBJECT
OF OUR INVESTIGATION</h2>

<p>Karl Marx made a contribution of lasting service to the
theory of economics when he drew attention to the problem
of the reproduction of the entire social capital. It is
significant that in the history of economics we find only two
attempts at an exact exposition of this problem: one by Quesnay,
the father of the Physiocrats, at its very inception; and in its
final stage this attempt by Marx. In the interim, the problem
was ever with bourgeois economics. Yet bourgeois economists
have never been fully aware of this problem in its pure aspects,
detached from related and intersecting minor problems; they
have never been able to formulate it precisely, let alone solve it.
Seeing that the problem is of paramount importance, their
attempts may all the same help us to some understanding of the
trend of scientific economics.</p>

<p>What is it precisely that constitutes this problem of the reproduction
of total capital? The literal meaning of the word &#8216;reproduction&#8217;
is repetition, renewal of the process of production. At
first sight it may be difficult to see in what respect the idea of
reproduction differs from that of repetition which we can all
understand&mdash;why such a new and unfamiliar term should be
required. But in the sort of repetition which we shall consider,
in the continual recurrence of the process of production, there
are certain distinctive features. First, the regular repetition of
reproduction is the general <i>sine qua non</i> of regular consumption
which in its turn has been the precondition of human civilisation
in every one of its historical forms. The concept of reproduction,
viewed in this way, reflects an aspect of the history of
civilisation. Production can never be resumed, there can be no
reproduction, unless certain prerequisites such as tools, raw
materials and labour have been established during the preceding
period of production. However, at the most primitive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
level of man&#8217;s civilisation, at the initial stage of man&#8217;s power
over nature; this possibility to re-engage in production depended
more or less on chance. So long as hunting and fishing were the
main foundations of social existence, frequent periods of general
starvation interrupted the regular repetition of production.
Some primitive peoples recognised at a very early stage that for
reproduction as a regularly recurring process certain measures
were essential; these they incorporated into ceremonies of a
religious nature; and in this way they accepted such measures
as traditional social commitments. Thus, as the thorough researches
of Spencer and Gillen have taught us, the totem cult of
the Australian negroes is fundamentally nothing but certain
measures taken by social groups for the purpose of securing and
preserving their animal and vegetable foodstuffs; these precautions
had been taken year by year since time immemorial
and thus they became fossilised into religious ceremonials. Yet
the circle of consumption and production which forms the
essence of reproduction became possible only with the invention
of tillage with the hoe, with the taming of domestic animals, and
with cattle-raising for the purpose of consumption. Reproduction
is something more than mere repetition in so far as it presupposes
a certain level of society&#8217;s supremacy over nature, or,
in economic terms, a certain standard of labour productivity.</p>

<p>On the other hand, at all stages of social development, the
process of production is based on the continuation of two different,
though closely connected factors, the technical and social
conditions&mdash;on the precise relationship between man and nature
and that between men and men. Reproduction depends to the
same degree on both these conditions. We have just seen how
reproduction is bound up with the conditions of human working
techniques, how far it is indeed solely the result of a certain
level of labour productivity; but the social forms of production
prevailing in each case are no less decisive. In a primitive communist
agrarian community, reproduction as well as the whole
plan of economic life is determined by the community of all
workers and their democratic organs. The decision to re-engage
in labour&mdash;the organisation of labour&mdash;the provision of raw
materials, tools, and man-power as the essential preliminaries
of labour&mdash;the arrangement of reproduction and the determination
of its volume are all results of a planned co-operation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
in which everybody within the boundaries of the community
takes his part. In an economic system based on slave labour or
<i>corvée</i>, reproduction is enforced and regulated in all details by
personal relations of domination. Here the volume of reproduction
is determined by the right of disposal held by the ruling
<i>élites</i> over smaller or larger circles of other people&#8217;s labour. In a
society producing by capitalist methods, reproduction assumes a
peculiar form, as a mere glance at certain striking phenomena
will show us. In every other society known to history, reproduction
recurs in a regular sequence as far as its preconditions, the
existing means of production and labour power, make this possible.
As a rule, only external influences such as a devastating
war or a great pestilence, depopulating vast areas of former
cultural life, and consequently destroying masses of labour
power and of accumulated means of production, can result in a
complete interruption of reproduction or in its contraction to
any considerable extent for longer or shorter periods. A despotic
organisation of the plan of production may on occasion lead to
similar phenomena. When in ancient Egypt Pharaoh&#8217;s will
chained thousands of fellaheen for decades to the building of the
pyramids; when in modern Egypt Ismail Pasha ordered 20,000
fellaheen to forced labour on the Suez Canal; or when, about
two hundred years before Christ, the Emperor Shi Hoang Ti,
founder of the Chin dynasty, allowed 400,000 people to perish
of hunger and exhaustion and thus sacrificed a whole generation
to his purpose of consolidating the Great Wall at China&#8217;s
northern frontier, the result was always that vast stretches of
arable land were left fallow and that regular economic life was
interrupted for long periods. In all these cases the causes of
these interruptions of reproduction obviously lay in the one-sided
determination of the plan of reproduction by those in
power.</p>

<p>Societies which produce according to capitalist methods present
a different picture. We observe that in certain periods all
the ingredients of reproduction may be available, both labour
and means of production, and yet some vital needs of society for
consumer goods may be left unfulfilled. We find that in spite of
these resources reproduction may in part be completely suspended
and in part curtailed. Here it is no despotic interference
with the economic plan that is responsible for the difficulties in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the process of production. Quite apart from all technical conditions,
reproduction here depends on purely social considerations:
only those goods are produced which can with certainty
be expected to sell, and not merely to sell, but to sell at the customary
profit. Thus profit becomes an end in itself, the decisive
factor which determines not only production but also reproduction.
Not only does it decide in each case what work is to be
undertaken, how it is to be carried out, and how the products
are to be distributed; what is more, profit decides, also, at the
end of every working period, whether the labour process is to
be resumed, and, if so, to what extent and in what direction it
should be made to operate.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>In capitalist society, therefore, the process of reproduction as
a whole, constitutes a peculiar and most complicated problem,
in consequence of these purely historical and social factors.
There is, as we shall see, an external characteristic which shows
clearly this specific historical peculiarity of the capitalist process
of reproduction. Comprising not only production but also
circulation (the process of exchange), it unites these two elements.
Capitalist production is primarily production by innumerable
private producers without any planned regulation.
The only social link between these producers is the act of
exchange. In taking account of social requirements reproduction
has no clue to go on other than the experiences of the
preceding labour period. These experiences, however, remain
the private experiences of individual producers and are not integrated
into a comprehensive and social form. Moreover, they
do not always refer positively and directly to the needs of
society. They are often rather indirect and negative, for it is
only on the basis of price fluctuations that they indicate whether
the aggregate of produced commodities falls short of the effective
demand or exceeds it. Yet the individual private producers
make recurrent use of these experiences of the preceding labour
period when they re-engage in reproduction, so that glut or
shortage are bound to occur again in the following period. Individual
branches of production may develop independently, so
that there may be a surplus in one branch and a deficiency in
another. But as nearly all individual branches of production
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
are interdependent technically, glut or shortage in some of the
larger branches of production lead to the same phenomenon in
most of the others. Thus the general supply of products may
alternate periodically between shortage and surplus relative to
the social demand.</p>

<p>Herein lies the peculiar character of reproduction in a capitalist
society, which differs from all other known forms of production.
In the first place, every branch of production develops
independently within certain limits, in a way that leads to
periodical interruptions of production of shorter or longer duration.
Secondly, the individual branches of reproduction show
deviations from social requirements amounting to all-round
disparity and thus resulting in a general interruption of reproduction.
These features of capitalist reproduction are quite
characteristic. In all other economic systems, reproduction runs
its uninterrupted and regular course, apart from external
disturbance by violence. Capitalist reproduction, however, to
quote Sismondi&#8217;s well-known dictum, can only be represented
as a continuous sequence of individual spirals. Every such spiral
starts with small loops which become increasingly larger and
eventually very large indeed. Then they contract, and a new
spiral starts again with small loops, repeating the figure up to
the point of interruption. This periodical fluctuation between
the largest volume of reproduction and its contraction to
partial suspension, this cycle of slump, boom, and crisis, as it
has been called, is the most striking peculiarity of capitalist
reproduction.</p>

<p>It is very important, however, to establish quite firmly and
from the very outset that this cyclical movement of boom,
slump, and crisis, does not represent the whole problem of
capitalist reproduction, although it is an essential element of it.
Periodical cycles and crises are specific phases of reproduction
in a capitalist system of economy, but not the whole of this process.
In order to demonstrate the pure implications of capitalist
reproduction we must rather consider it quite apart from the
periodical cycles and crises. Strange as this may appear, the
method is quite rational; it is indeed the only method of inquiry
that is scientifically tenable. In order to demonstrate and to
solve the problem of pure value we must leave price fluctuations
out of consideration. The approach of vulgar economics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
always attempts to solve the problem of value by reference to
fluctuations in demand and supply. Classical economists, from
Adam Smith to Karl Marx, attack the problem in the opposite
way, pointing out that fluctuations in the mutual relation
between demand and supply can explain only disparities between
price and value, not value itself. In order to find the
value of a commodity, we must start by assuming that
demand and supply are in a state of equilibrium, that the
price of a commodity and its value closely correspond to one
another. Thus the scientific problem of value begins at the
very point where the effect of demand and supply ceases to
operate.</p>

<p>In consequence of periodical cycles and crises capitalist reproduction
fluctuates as a rule around the level of the effective
total demand of society, sometimes rising above and sometimes
falling below this level, contracting occasionally even to the
point of almost complete interruption of reproduction. However,
if we consider a longer period, a whole cycle with its alternating
phases of prosperity and depression, of boom and slump,
that is if we consider reproduction at its highest and lowest
volume, including the stage of suspension, we can set off boom
against slump and work out an average, a mean volume of
reproduction for the whole cycle. This average is not only a
theoretical figment of thought, it is also a real objective fact.
For in spite of the sharp rises and falls in the course of a cycle,
in spite of crises, the needs of society are always satisfied more
or less, reproduction continues on its complicated course, and
productive capacities develop progressively. How can this take
place, leaving cycles and crises out of consideration? Here the
real question begins. The attempt to solve the problem of reproduction
in terms of the periodical character of crises is fundamentally
a device of vulgar economics, just like the attempt to
solve the problem of value in terms of fluctuations in demand
and supply. Nevertheless, we shall see in the course of our
observations that as soon as economic theory gets an inkling of
the problem of reproduction, as soon as it has at least started
guessing at the problem, it reveals a persistent tendency suddenly
to transform the problem of reproduction into the problem
of crises, thus barring its own way to the solution of the
question. When we speak of capitalist reproduction in the following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
exposition, we shall always understand by this term a
mean volume of productivity which is an average taken over
the various phases of a cycle.</p>

<p>Now, the total of capitalist reproduction is created by an
unlimited and constantly changing number of private producers.
They produce independently of one another; apart from
the observation of price fluctuations there is no social control&mdash;no
social link exists between the individual producers other than
the exchange of commodities. The question arises how these
innumerable disconnected operations can lead to the actual
total of production. This general aspect of our problem indeed
strikes us immediately as one of prime importance. But if we
put it this way, we overlook the fact that such private producers
are not simply producers of commodities but are essentially
capitalist producers, that the total production of society is not
simply production for the sake of satisfying social requirements,
and equally not merely production of commodities, but essentially
capitalist production.</p>

<p>Let us examine our problem anew in the light of this fact.
A producer who produces not only commodities but capital
must above all create surplus value. The capitalist producer&#8217;s
final goal, his main incentive, is the production of surplus value.
The proceeds from the commodities he has manufactured must
not only recompense him for all his outlay, but in addition
they must yield him a value which does not correspond with
any expense on his part, and is pure gain. If we consider the
process of production from the point of view of the creation of
surplus value, we see that the capital advanced by the capitalist
is divided into two parts: the first part represents his expenses
on means of production such as premises, raw material, partly
finished goods and machinery. The second part is spent on
wages. This holds good, even if the capitalist producer does not
know it himself, and in spite of the pious stuff about fixed and
circulating capital with which he may delude himself and the
world. Marx called this first part constant capital. Its value is
not changed by its utilisation in the labour process&mdash;it is transferred
<i>in toto</i> to the finished product. The second part Marx
calls the variable capital. This gives rise to an additional value,
which materialises when the results of unpaid labour are appropriated.
The various components which make up the value of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
every commodity produced by capitalist methods may be expressed
by the formula: <i>c</i>&nbsp;+ <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>. In this formula <i>c</i> stands for the
value of the constant capital laid out in inanimate means of
production and transferred to the commodity, <i>v</i> stands for the
value of the variable capital advanced in form of wages, and
<i>s</i> stands for the surplus value, the additional value of the unpaid
part of wage labour. Every type of goods shows these three
components of value, whether we consider an individual commodity
or the aggregate of commodities as a whole, whether we
consider cotton textiles or ballet performances, cast-iron tubes
or liberal newspapers. Thus for the capitalist producer the
manufacture of commodities is not an end in itself, it is only a
means to the appropriation of surplus value. This surplus value,
however, can be of no use to the capitalist so long as it remains
hidden in the commodity form of the product. Once the commodity
has been produced, it must be realised, it must be converted
into a form of pure value; that is, into money. All capital
expenses incorporated in the commodity must shed their commodity-form
and revert to the capitalist as money to make this
conversion possible so that he can appropriate the surplus value
in cash. The purpose of production is fulfilled only when this
conversion has been successful, only when the aggregate of
commodities has been sold according to its value. The proceeds
of this sale of commodities, the money that has been received
for them, contains the same components of value as the former
aggregate of commodities and can be expressed by the same
formula <i>c</i>&nbsp;+ <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>. Part <i>c</i> recompenses the capitalist for his
advances on means of production that have been used up, part
<i>v</i> recompenses him for his advances on wages, and the last part,
<i>s</i>, represents the expected surplus, the capitalist&#8217;s clear profit in
cash.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>This conversion of capital from its original form, from the
starting point of all capitalist production, into means of production,
dead and living, such as raw materials, instruments,
and labour; its further conversion into commodities by a living
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
labour process; and its final reconversion into money, a greater
amount of money indeed than at the initial stage&mdash;this transformation
of capital is, however, required for more than the
production and appropriation of surplus value. The aim and
incentive of capitalist production is not a surplus value pure
and simple, to be appropriated in any desired quantity, but a
surplus value ever growing into larger quantities, surplus value
<i>ad infinitum</i>. But to achieve this aim, the same magic means
must be used over and over again, the means of capitalist production&mdash;the
ever repeated appropriation of the proceeds of unpaid
wage labour in the process of commodity manufacture, and
the subsequent realisation of the commodities so produced.</p>

<p>Thus quite a new incentive is given to constantly renewed
production, to the process of reproduction as a regular phenomenon
in capitalist society, an incentive unknown to any other
system of production. In every other economic system known to
history, reproduction is determined by the unceasing need of
society for consumer goods, whether they are the needs of all
the workers determined in a democratic manner as in an
agrarian and communist market community, or the despotically
determined needs of an antagonistic class society, as in an
economy of slave labour or <i>corvée</i> and the like. But in a capitalist
system of production, it is not consideration of social needs
which actuates the individual private producer who alone
matters in this connection. His production is determined entirely
by the effective demand, and even this is to him a mere means
for the realisation of surplus value which for him is indispensable.
Appropriation of surplus value is his real incentive, and
production of consumer goods for the satisfaction of the effective
demand is only a detour when we look to the real motive,
that of appropriation of surplus value, although for the individual
capitalist it is also a rule of necessity. This motive, to
appropriate surplus value, also urges him to re-engage in reproduction
over and over again. It is the production of surplus
value which turns reproduction of social necessities into a <i>perpetuum
mobile</i>. Reproduction, for its part, can obviously be only
resumed when the products of the previous period, the commodities,
have been realised; that is, converted into money; for
capital in the form of money, in the form of pure value, must
always be the starting point of reproduction in a capitalist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
system. The first condition of reproduction for the capitalist
producer is thus seen to be a successful realisation of the commodities
produced during the preceding period of production.</p>

<p>Now we come to a second important point. Under a system of
private economy, it is the individual producer who determines
the volume of reproduction at his discretion. His main incentive
is appropriation of surplus value, indeed an appropriation increasing
as rapidly as possible. An accelerated appropriation of
surplus value, however, necessitates an increased production of
capital to generate this surplus value. Here a large-scale enterprise
enjoys advantages over a small one in every respect. In
fine, the capitalist method of production furnishes not only a
permanent incentive to reproduction in general, but also a
motive for its expansion, for reproduction on an ever larger
scale.</p>

<p>Nor is that all. Capitalist methods of production do more
than awaken in the capitalist this thirst for surplus value
whereby he is impelled to ceaseless expansion of reproduction.
Expansion becomes in truth a coercive law, an economic condition
of existence for the individual capitalist. Under the rule
of competition, cheapness of commodities is the most important
weapon of the individual capitalist in his struggle for a place in
the market. Now all methods of reducing the cost of commodity
production permanently amount in the end to an expansion of
production; excepting those only which aim at a specific increase
of the rate of surplus value by measures such as wage-cutting
or lengthening the hours of work. As for these latter
devices, they are as such likely to encounter many obstacles. In
this respect, a large enterprise invariably enjoys advantages of
every kind over a small or medium concern. They may range
from a saving in premises or instruments, in the application of
more efficient means of production, in extensive replacement
of manual labour by machinery, down to a speedy exploitation of
a favourable turn of the market so as to acquire raw materials
cheaply. Within very wide limits, these advantages increase in
direct proportion to the expansion of the enterprise. Thus, as
soon as a few capitalist enterprises have been enlarged, competition
itself forces all others to expand likewise. Expansion
becomes a condition of existence. A growing tendency towards
reproduction at a progressively increasing scale thus ensues,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
which spreads automatically like a tidal wave over ever larger
surfaces of reproduction.</p>

<p>Expanding reproduction is not a new discovery of capital.
On the contrary, it had been the rule since time immemorial in
every form of society that displayed economic and cultural progress.
It is true, of course, that simple reproduction as a mere
continuous repetition of the process of production on the same
scale as before can be observed over long periods of social history.
In the ancient agrarian and communist village communities,
for instance, increase in population did not lead to a
gradual expansion of production, but rather to the new generation
being expelled and the subsequent founding of equally
small and self-sufficient colonies. The old small handicraft units
of India and China provide similar instances of a traditional
repetition of production in the same forms and on the same
scale, handed down from generation to generation. But simple
reproduction is in all these cases the source and unmistakable
sign of a general economic and cultural stagnation. No important
forward step in production, no memorial of civilisation,
such as the great waterworks of the East, the pyramids of Egypt,
the military roads of Rome, the Arts and Sciences of Greece,
or the development of craftsmanship and towns in the Middle
Ages would have been possible without expanding reproduction;
for the basis and also the social incentive for a decisive
advancement of civilisation lies solely in the gradual expansion
of production beyond immediate requirements, and in a continual
growth of the population itself as well as of its demands.</p>

<p>Exchange in particular, which brought about a class society,
and its historical development into the capitalist form of
economy, would have been unthinkable without expanding
reproduction. In a capitalist society, moreover, expanding reproduction
acquires certain characteristics. As we have already
mentioned, it becomes right away a coercive law to the individual
capitalist. Capitalist methods of production do not exclude
simple or even retrogressive reproduction; indeed, this is
responsible for the periodical phenomenon of crises following
phases, likewise periodical, of overstrained expansion of reproduction
in times of boom. But ignoring periodical fluctuations,
the general trend of reproduction is ever towards expansion.
For the individual capitalist, failure to keep abreast of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
expansion means quitting the competitive struggle, economic
death.</p>

<p>Moreover, there are certain other aspects to be considered.
The concept of expanding reproduction applies only to the
quantity of products, to the aggregate of manufactured objects.
So long as production rests solely or mainly upon a natural
economy, consumption determines the extent and character of
the individual labour process, as well as that of reproduction in
general, as an end in itself: this applies to the agrarian and
communist village communities of India, to the Roman <i>villa</i>
with its economy of slave labour, and to the medieval feudal
farm based on <i>corvée</i>. But the picture is different in a capitalist
economic system. Capitalist production is not production for
the purpose of consumption, it is production for the purpose of
creating value. The whole process of production as well as of
reproduction is ruled by value relationships. Capitalist production
is not the production of consumer goods, nor is it merely
the production of commodities: it is pre-eminently the production
of surplus value. Expanding reproduction, from a capitalist
point of view, is expanding production of surplus value, though
it takes place in the forms of commodity production and is thus
in the last instance the production of consumer goods. Changes
in the productivity of labour during the course of reproduction
cause continual discrepancies between these two aspects. If
productivity increases, the same amount of capital and surplus
value may represent a progressively larger amount of consumer
goods. Expanding production, understood as the creation of a
greater amount of surplus value, need not therefore necessarily
imply expanding reproduction in the capitalist meaning of the
term. Conversely, capital may, within limits, yield a greater
surplus value in consequence of a higher degree of exploitation
such as is brought about by wage-cutting and the like, without
actually producing a greater amount of goods. But in both cases
the surplus value has a twofold aspect: it is a quantity of value
as well as an aggregate of material products, and from a capitalist
point of view, its elements in both instances are thus the
same.</p>

<p>As a rule, an increased production of surplus value results
from an increase of capital brought about by addition of part of
the appropriated surplus value to the original capital, no matter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
whether this capitalist surplus value is used for the expansion of
an old enterprise or for founding a new one, an independent
offshoot. Capitalist expanding reproduction thus acquires the
specific characteristics of an increase in capital by means of a
progressive capitalisation of surplus value, or, as Marx has put
it, by the accumulation of capital.</p>

<p>The general formula for enlarged reproduction under the
rule of capital thus runs as follows: <i>c</i>&nbsp;+ <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <span class="fraction" title="s over x"><sup><i>s</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>x</i></sub></span>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>´. Here <span class="fraction" title="s over x"><sup><i>s</i></sup>&frasl;<sub><i>x</i></sub></span> stands
for the capitalised part of the surplus value appropriated in an
earlier period of production; <i>s</i>´ stands for the new surplus value
created by the increased capital. Part of this new surplus value
is capitalised again, and expanding reproduction is thus, from
the capitalist point of view, a constantly flowing process of alternate
appropriation and capitalisation of surplus value.</p>

<p>So far, however, we have only arrived at a general and
abstract formula for reproduction. Let us now consider more
closely the concrete conditions which are necessary to apply
this formula.</p>

<p>The surplus value which has been appropriated, after it has
successfully cast off its commodity-form in the market, appears
as a given amount of money. This money-form is the form of
its absolute value, the beginning of its career as capital. But as
it is impossible to create surplus value with money, it cannot,
in this form, advance beyond the threshold of its career. Capital
must assume commodity-form, so that the particular portion of
it which is earmarked for accumulation can be capitalised. For
only in this form can it become productive capital; that is,
capital begetting new surplus value. Therefore, like the original
capital, it must again be divided into two parts; a constant part,
comprising the inanimate means of production, and a variable
part, the wages. Only then will our formula <i>c</i>&nbsp;+ <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> apply to it
in the same way as it applied to the old capital.</p>

<p>But the good intent of the capitalist to accumulate, his thrift
and abstinence which make him use the greater part of his
surplus value for production instead of squandering it on personal
luxuries, is not sufficient for this purpose. On the contrary,
it is essential that he should find on the commodity
market the concrete forms which he intends to give his new
surplus value. In the first place, he must secure the material
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
means of production such as raw materials, machines etc. required
for the branch of production he has chosen and planned,
so that the particular part of the surplus value which corresponds
to his constant capital may assume a productive form.
Secondly, the other, variable part of his surplus value must also
be convertible, and two essentials are necessary for this conversion:
of first importance, the labour market must offer a
sufficient quantity of additional labour, and secondly, as the
workers cannot live on money alone, the commodity market,
too, must offer an additional amount of provisions, which the
workers newly to be employed may exchange against the variable
part of the surplus value they will get from the capitalist.</p>

<p>All these prerequisites found, the capitalist can set his capitalised
surplus value to work and make it, as operating capital,
beget new surplus value. But still his task is not completely
done. Both the new capital and the surplus value produced still
exist for the time being in the shape of an additional quantity
of some commodity or other. In this form the new capital is but
advanced, and the new surplus value created by it is still in a
form in which it is of no use to the capitalist. The new capital
as well as the surplus value which it has created must cast off
their commodity-form, re-assume the form of pure value, and
thus revert to the capitalist as money. Unless this process is
successfully concluded, the new capital and surplus value will
be wholly or partly lost, the capitalisation of surplus value will
have miscarried, and there will have been no accumulation. It
is absolutely essential to the accumulation of capital that a
sufficient quantity of commodities created by the new capital
should win a place for itself on the market and be realised.</p>

<p>Thus we see that expanding reproduction as accumulation of
capital in a capitalist system is bound up with a whole series
of special conditions. Let us look at these more closely. The first
condition is that production should create surplus value, for
surplus value is the elementary form in which alone increased
production is possible under capitalist conditions. The entire
process of production must abide by this condition when determining
the relations between capitalist and worker in the production
of commodities. Once this first condition is given, the
second is that surplus value must be realised, converted into the
form of money, so that it can be appropriated for the purposes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
of expanding reproduction. This second condition thus leads us
to the commodity market. Here, the hazards of exchange decide
the further fate of the surplus value, and thus the future of reproduction.
The third condition is as follows: provided that part
of the realised surplus value has been added to capital for the
purpose of accumulation, this new capital must first assume its
productive form of labour and inanimate means of production.
Moreover, that part of it which had been exchanged for labour
must be converted into provisions for the workers. Thus we are
led again to the markets of labour and commodities. If all these
requirements have been met and enlarged reproduction of commodities
has taken place, a fourth condition must be added: the
additional quantity of commodities representing the new capital
plus surplus value will have to be realised, that is, reconverted
into money. Only if this conversion has been successful, can it
be said that expanding capitalist reproduction has actually
taken place. This last condition leads us back to the commodity
market.</p>

<p>Thus capitalist production and reproduction imply a constant
shifting between the place of production and the commodity
market, a shuttle movement from the private office and
the factory where unauthorised persons are strictly excluded,
where the sovereign will of the individual capitalist is the highest
law, to the commodity market where nobody sets up any laws
and where neither will nor reason assert themselves. But it is
this very licence and anarchy of the commodity market which
brings home to the individual capitalist that he is dependent
upon society, upon the entirety of its producing and consuming
members. The individual capitalist may need additional means
of production, additional labour and provisions for these
workers in order to expand reproduction, but whether he can
get what he needs depends upon factors and events beyond his
control, materialising, as it were, behind his back. In order to
realise his increased aggregate of products, the individual capitalist
requires a larger market for his goods, but he has no control
whatever over the actual increase of demand in general, or of
the particular demand for his special kind of good.</p>

<p>The conditions we have enumerated here, which all give expression
to the inherent contradiction between consumption
and private production and their social interconnection, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
nothing new, and it is not only at the stage of reproduction that
they become apparent. These conditions express the general
contradiction inherent in capitalist production. They involve,
however, particular difficulties as regards the process of reproduction
for the following reasons. With regard to reproduction,
especially expanding reproduction, the capitalist method of
production not only reveals its general fundamental character,
but, what is more, it shows, in the various periods of production,
a definite rhythm within a continuous progression&mdash;the
characteristic interplay of individual wills. From this point of
view, we must inquire in a general way how it is possible for
every individual capitalist to find on the market the means of
production and the labour he requires for the purpose of
realising the commodities he has produced, although there
exists no social control whatever, no plan to harmonize production
and demand. This question may be answered by saying
that the capitalist&#8217;s greed for surplus value, enhanced by competition,
and the automatic effects of capitalist exploitation,
lead to the production of every kind of commodity, including
means of production, and also that a growing class of proletarianised
workers becomes generally available for the purposes
of capital. On the other hand, the lack of a plan in this
respect shows itself in the fact that the balance between demand
and supply in all spheres can be achieved only by continuous
deviations, by hourly fluctuations of prices, and by periodical
crises and changes of the market situation.</p>

<p>From the point of view of reproduction the question is a different
one. How is it possible that the unplanned supply in the
market for labour and means of production, and the unplanned
and incalculable changes in demand nevertheless provide adequate
quantities and qualities of means of production, labour
and opportunities for selling which the individual capitalist
needs in order to make a sale? How can it be assured that every
one of these factors increases in the right proportion? Let us put
the problem more precisely. According to our well-known formula,
let the composition of the individual capitalist&#8217;s production
be expressed by the proportion 40<i>c</i>&nbsp;+ 10<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ 10<i>s</i>. His constant
capital is consequently four times as much as his variable
capital, and the rate of exploitation is 100 per cent. The aggregate
of commodities is thus represented by a value of 60. Let us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
now assume that the capitalist is in a position to capitalise and
to add to the old capital of this given composition half of his
surplus value. In this case, the formula 44<i>c</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;11<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ 11<i>s</i>&nbsp;= 66
would apply to the next period of production.</p>

<p>Let us assume now that the capitalist can continue the annual
capitalisation of half his surplus value for a number of years.
For this purpose it is not sufficient that means of production,
labour and markets in general should be forthcoming, but he
must find these factors in a proportion that is strictly in keeping
with his progress in accumulation.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER II</i></h2>

<h2>QUESNAY&#8217;S AND ADAM SMITH&#8217;S
ANALYSES OF THE PROCESS OF
REPRODUCTION</h2>

<p>So far we have taken account only of the individual capitalist
in our survey of reproduction; he is its typical representative,
its agent, for reproduction is indeed brought
about entirely by individual capitalist enterprises. This approach
has already shown us that the problem involves difficulties
enough. Yet these difficulties increase to an extraordinary degree
and become even more complicated, when we turn our attention
from the individual capitalist to the totality of capitalists.</p>

<p>A superficial glance suffices to show that capitalist reproduction
as a social whole must not be regarded simply as a
mechanical summation of all the separate processes of individual
capitalist reproduction. We have seen, for instance, that
one of the fundamental conditions for enlarged reproduction by
an individual capitalist is a corresponding increase of his opportunities
to sell on the commodity market. But the individual
capitalist may not always expand because of an absolute
increase in the absorptive capacity of the market, but also as a
result of the competitive struggle, at the cost of other individual
capitalists. Thus one capitalist may win what another or many
others who have been shouldered from the market must write
off as a loss. This process will enable one capitalist to increase
his reproduction by the amount that it compels others by losses
to restrict their own. One capitalist will be able to engage in
enlarged reproduction because others cannot even achieve
simple reproduction. In the same way, one capitalist may
enlarge his reproduction by using labour power and means of
production which another&#8217;s bankruptcy, that is his partial or
complete retirement from reproduction, has set free.</p>

<p>These commonplaces prove that reproduction of the social
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
capital as a whole is not the same as the reproduction of the
individual capitalist raised to the <i>n</i>th degree. They show that
the reproductive activities of individual capitalists ceaselessly
cut across one another and to a greater or smaller degree may
cancel each other out.</p>

<p>Therefore we must clarify our concept of reproduction of
capital as a whole, before we examine the laws and mechanisms
of capitalist total reproduction. We must raise the question
whether it is even possible to deduce anything like total reproduction
from the disorderly jumble of individual capitals in
constant motion, changing from moment to moment according
to uncontrollable and incalculable laws, partly running a
parallel course, and partly intersecting and cancelling each
other out. Can one actually talk of total social capital of society
as an entity, and if so, what is the real meaning of this concept?
That is the first question a scientific examination of the laws of
reproduction has to consider. At the dawn of economic theory
and bourgeois economics, Quesnay, the father of the Physiocrats,
approached the problem with classical fearlessness and
simplicity and took it for granted that total capital exists as a
real and active entity. In his famous <i>Tableau Économique</i>, so intricate
that no one before Marx could understand it, Quesnay
demonstrated the phases of the reproduction of aggregate
capital with a few figures, at the same time taking into account
that it must also be considered from the aspect of commodity
exchange, that is as a process of circulation.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Society as Quesnay sees it consists of three classes: the productive
class of agriculturists; the sterile class containing all
those who are active outside the sphere of agriculture&mdash;industry,
commerce, and the liberal professions; and lastly the class
of landowners, including the Sovereign and the collectors of
tithes. The national aggregate product materialises in the hands
of the productive class as an aggregate of provisions and raw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
materials to the value of some 5,000 million livres. Of this sum,
2,000 millions represent the annual working capital of agriculture,
1,000 millions represent the annual wear and tear of fixed
capital, and 2,000 millions are the net revenue accruing to the
landowners. Apart from this total produce, the agriculturists,
here conceived quite in capitalist terms as tenant farmers, have
2,000 million livres cash in hand. Circulation now takes place
in such a way that the tenant class pay the landowners 2,000
millions cash as rent (as the cost of the previous period of production).
For this money the landowning class buy provisions
from the tenants for 1,000 millions and industrial products from
the sterile class for the remaining 1,000 millions. The tenants in
their turn buy industrial products for the 1,000 millions handed
back to them, whereupon the sterile class buy agricultural products
for the 2,000 millions they have in hand: for 1,000 millions
raw materials etc., to replace their annual working capital, and
provisions for the remaining 1,000 millions. Thus the money has
in the end returned to its starting point, the tenant class; the
product is distributed among all classes so that consumption is
ensured for everyone; at the same time the means of production
of the sterile as well as of the productive class have been renewed
and the landowning class has received its revenue. The
prerequisites of reproduction are all present, the conditions of
circulation have all been fulfilled, and reproduction can start
again on its regular course.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>We shall see later in the course of our investigation that this
exposition, though showing flashes of genius, remains deficient
and primitive. In any case, we must stress here that Quesnay,
on the threshold of scientific economics, had not the slightest
doubt as to the possibility of demonstrating total social capital
and its reproduction. Adam Smith, on the other hand, while
giving a more profound analysis of the relations of capital, laid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
out what seems like a maze when compared with the clear and
sweeping outlines of the Physiocrat conception. By his wrong
analysis of prices, Smith upset the whole foundation of the
scientific demonstration of the capitalist process as a whole.
This wrong analysis of prices ruled bourgeois economics for a
long time; it is the theory which maintains that, although the
value of a commodity represents the amount of labour spent in
its production, yet the price consists of three elements only: the
wage of labour, the profit of capital, and the rent.</p>

<p>As this obviously must also apply to the aggregate of commodities,
the national product, we are faced with the startling
discovery that, although the value of the aggregate of commodities
manufactured by capitalist methods represents all
paid wages together with the profits of capital and the rents,
that is the aggregate surplus value, and consequently can replace
these, there is no component of value which corresponds
to the constant capital used in production. According to Smith,
<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> is the formula expressing the value of the capitalist product
as a whole. Demonstrating his view with the example of corn,
Smith says as follows:</p>

<p>&#8216;These three parts (wages, profit, and rent) seem either
immediately or ultimately to make up the whole price of corn.
A fourth part, it may perhaps be thought, is necessary for replacing
the stock of the farmer, or for compensating the wear
and tear of his labouring cattle, and other instruments of husbandry.
But it must be considered that the price of any instrument
of husbandry, such as a labouring horse, is itself made up
of the same three parts: the rent of the land upon which he is
reared, the labour of tending and rearing him, and the profits
of the farmer who advances both the rent of this land and the
wages of this labour. Though the price of the corn, therefore,
may pay the price as well as the maintenance of the horse, the
whole price still resolves itself either immediately or ultimately
into the same three parts of rent, of labour and profit.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Sending us in this manner &#8216;from pillar to post&#8217;, as Marx has
put it, Smith again and again resolved constant capital into
<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>. However, he had occasional doubts and from time to time
relapsed into the contrary opinion. He says in the second book:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
&#8216;It has been shown in the first Book, that the price of the
greater part of commodities resolves itself into three parts, of
which one pays the wages of the labour, another the profits of
the stock, and a third the rent of the land which had been
employed in producing and bringing them to market.... Since
this is the case ... with regard to every particular commodity,
taken separately; it must be so with regard to all the commodities
which compose the whole annual produce of the land and
labour of every country, taken complexly. The whole price or
exchangeable value of that annual produce must resolve itself
into the same three parts, and be parcelled out among the
different inhabitants of the country, either as the wages of their
labour, the profits of their stock, or the rent of their land.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Here Smith hesitates and immediately below explains: &#8216;But
though the whole value of the annual produce of the land and
labour of every country is thus divided among and constitutes
a revenue to its different inhabitants, yet as in the rent of a
private estate we distinguish between the gross rent and the neat
rent, so may we likewise in the revenue of all the inhabitants of
a great country.</p>

<p>&#8216;The gross rent of a private estate comprehends whatever is
paid by the farmer; the neat rent, what remains free to the
landlord after deducting the expense of management, of repairs,
and all other necessary charges; or what, without hurting his
estate, he can afford to place in his stock reserved for immediate
consumption, or to spend upon his table, equipage, the ornaments
of his house and furniture, his private enjoyments and
amusements. His real wealth is in proportion, not to his gross,
but to his neat rent.</p>

<p>&#8216;The gross revenue of all the inhabitants of a great country
comprehends the whole annual produce of their land and
labour; the neat revenue, what remains free to them after
deducting the expense of maintaining, first, their fixed, and
secondly, their circulating capital, or what, without encroaching
upon their capital, they can place in their stock reserved for
immediate consumption, or spend upon their subsistence, conveniences,
and amusements. Their real wealth too is in proportion,
not to their gross, but to their neat revenue.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Here Smith introduces a portion of value which corresponds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
to constant capital, only to eliminate it the very next moment
by resolving it into wages, profits, and rents. And in the end, the
matter rests with this explanation:</p>

<p>&#8216;As the machines and instruments of trade, etc. which compose
the fixed capital either of an individual or of a society,
make no part either of the gross or the neat revenue of either,
so money, by means of which the whole revenue of the society
is regularly distributed among all its different members, makes
itself no part of that revenue.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Constant capital, the fixed capital of Adam Smith, is thus put
on the same level as money and does not enter into the total
produce of society, its gross revenue. It does not exist within
this total product as an element of value.</p>

<p>You cannot get blood out of a stone, and so circulation, the
mutual exchange of the total product constituted in this manner,
can only lead to realisation of the wages (<i>v</i>) and of the surplus
value (<i>s</i>). However, as it cannot by any means replace the constant
capital, continued reproduction evidently must become
impossible. Smith indeed knew quite well, and did not dream
of denying, that every individual capitalist requires constant
capital in addition to his wages fund, his variable capital, in
order to run his enterprise. Yet the above analysis of commodity
prices, when it comes to take note of capitalist production as a
whole, allows constant capital to disappear without a trace in
a puzzling way. Thus the problem of the reproduction of capital
is completely muddled up. It is plain that if the most elementary
premise of the problem, the demonstration of social capital as
a whole, were on the rocks, the whole analysis was bound to fail.
Ricardo, Say, Sismondi and others took up this erroneous
theory of Adam Smith, and they all stumbled in their observations
on the problem of reproduction over this most elementary
difficulty: the demonstration of social capital.</p>

<p>Another difficulty is mixed up with the foregoing from the
very outset of scientific analysis. What is the nature of the total
capital of a society? As regards the individual producer, the
position is clear: his capital consists of the expenses of his enterprise.
Assuming capitalist methods of production, the value of
his product yields him a surplus over and above his expenses,
that surplus value which does not replace his capital but constitutes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
his net income, which he can consume completely without
encroaching upon his capital and which is thus his fund of
consumption. It is true that the capitalist may save part of this
net income, not consuming it himself but adding it to his
capital. But that is another matter, a new step, the formation
of a new capital which again must be replaced by subsequent
reproduction and must again yield him a surplus. In any case,
the capital of an individual always consists of what he requires
for production, together with his advances on the running of his
enterprise, and his income is what he himself actually consumes
or may consume, his fund of consumption. If we ask a capitalist:
&#8216;What are the wages you pay your workers?&#8217; his answer will be:
&#8216;They are obviously part of my working capital.&#8217; But if we ask:
&#8216;What are these wages for the workers who have received them?&#8217;&mdash;it
is impossible that he should describe them as capital, for
wages received are not capital for the workers but income, their
fund of consumption.</p>

<p>Let us now take another example. A manufacturer of
machinery produces machines in his factory. The annual output
is a certain number of machines. In its value, however, this
annual output contains the capital advanced by the manufacturer
as well as the net income that has been earned. Part of the
manufactured machines thus represent income for the manufacturer
and are destined to realise this income in the process
of circulation and exchange. But the person who buys these
machines from the manufacturer does not buy them as income
but in order to use them as a means of production; for him they
are capital.</p>

<p>These examples make it seem plausible that an object which is
capital for one person may be income for another and <i>vice versa</i>.
How can it be possible under these circumstances to construct
anything in the nature of a total capital of society? Indeed
almost every scientific economist up to the time of Marx concluded
that there is no social capital.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Smith was still doubtful,
undecided, vacillating about this question; so was Ricardo. But
already Say declared categorically:</p>

<p>&#8216;It is in this way, that the total value of products is distributed
amongst the members of the community; I say, the <i>total</i> value,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
because such part of the whole value produced, as does not go
to one of the consuming producers, is received by the rest. The
clothier buys wool of the farmer, pays his workmen in every
department, and sells the cloth, the result of their united exertion,
at a price that reimburses all his advances, and affords
himself a profit. He never reckons as profit, or as the revenue
of his own industry, anything more than the <i>net</i> surplus, after
deducting all charges and outgoings; but those outgoings are
merely an advance of their respective revenues to the previous
producers, which are refunded by the <i>gross</i> value of the cloth.
The price paid to the farmer for his wool is the compound of
the several revenues of the cultivator, the shepherd and the
landlord. Although the farmer reckons as <i>net</i> produce only the
surplus remaining after payment of his landlord and his servants
in husbandry, yet to them these payments are items of
revenue&mdash;rent to the one and wages to the other&mdash;to the one,
the revenue of the land, to the other, the revenue of his industry.
The aggregate of all these is defrayed out of the value of the
cloth, the whole of which forms the revenue of some one or
other, and is entirely absorbed in that way.&mdash;Whence it appears
that the term <i>net</i> produce applies only to the individual revenue
of each separate producer or adventurer in industry, but that
the aggregate of individual revenue, the total revenue of the
community, is equal to the <i>gross</i> produce of its land, capital and
industry, which entirely subverts the system of the economists
of the last century, who considered nothing but the net produce
of the land as farming revenue, and therefore concluded, that
this net produce was all that the community had to consume;
instead of closing with the obvious inference, that the whole of
what had been created, may also be consumed by mankind.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Say proves his theory in his own peculiar fashion. Whereas
Adam Smith tried to give a proof by referring each private
capital unit to its place of production in order to resolve it into
a mere product of labour, but conceived of every product of
labour in strictly capitalist terms as a sum of paid and unpaid
labour, as <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>, and thus came to resolve the total product of
society into <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>; Say, of course, is cocksure enough to &#8216;correct&#8217;
these classical errors by inflating them into common vulgarities.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
His argument is based upon the fact that the entrepreneur at
every stage of production pays other people, the representatives
of previous stages of production, for the means of production
which are capital for him, and that these people in their turn
put part of this payment into their own pockets as their income
and partly use it to recoup themselves for expenses advanced in
order to provide yet another set of people with an income. Say
converts Adam Smith&#8217;s endless chain of labour processes into an
equally unending chain of mutual advances on income and
their repayment from the proceeds of sales. The worker appears
here as the absolute equal of the entrepreneur. He has his
income advanced in the form of wages, paying for it in turn by
the labour he performs. Thus the final value of the aggregate
social product appears as the sum of a large number of advanced
incomes and is spent in the process of exchange on repayment
of all these advances. It is characteristic of Say&#8217;s superficiality
that he illustrates the social connections of capitalist reproduction
by the example of watch manufacture&mdash;a branch of production
which at that time and partly even to-day is pure
&#8216;manufacture&#8217; where every worker is also an entrepreneur on a
small scale and the process of production of surplus value is
masked by a series of successive acts of exchange typical of
simple commodity production.</p>

<p>Thus Say gives an extremely crude expression to the confusion
inaugurated by Adam Smith. The aggregate of annual
social produce can be completely resolved as regards its value
into a sequence of various incomes. Therefore it is completely
consumed every year. It remains an enigma how production can
be taken up again without capital and means of production,
and capitalist reproduction appears to be an insoluble problem.</p>

<p>If we compare the varying approaches to the problem from
the time of the Physiocrats to that of Adam Smith, we cannot
fail to recognise partial progress as well as partial regression.
The main characteristic of the economic conception of the
Physiocrats was their assumption that agriculture alone creates
a surplus, that is surplus value, and that agricultural labour is
the only kind of labour which is productive in the capitalist
sense of the term. Consequently we see in the <i>Tableau Économique</i>
that the unproductive class of industrial workers creates
value only to the extent of the same 2,000 million livres which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
it consumes as raw materials and foodstuffs. Consequently, too,
in the process of exchange, the total of manufactured products
is divided into two parts, one of which goes to the tenant class
and the other to the landowning class, while the manufacturing
class does not consume its own products. Thus in the value of
its commodities, the manufacturing class reproduces, strictly
speaking, only that circulating capital which has been consumed,
and no income is created for the class of entrepreneurs.
The only income of society that comes into circulation in excess
of all capital advances, is created in agriculture and is consumed
by the landowning class in the form of rents, while
even the tenant class do no more than replace their capital: to
wit, 1,000 million livres interest from the fixed capital and
2,000 million circulating capital, two-thirds being raw materials
and foodstuffs, and one-third industrial products. Further it is
striking that it is in agriculture alone that Quesnay assumes the
existence of fixed capital which he calls <i>avances primitives</i> as distinct
from <i>avances annuelles</i>. Industry, as he sees it, apparently
works without any fixed capital, only with circulating capital
turned over each year, and consequently does not create in its
annual output of commodities any element of value for making
good the wear and tear of fixed capital (such as premises, tools,
and so on).<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>In contrast with this obvious defect, the English classical
school shows a decisive advance above all in proclaiming every
kind of labour as productive, thus revealing the creation of
surplus value in manufacture as well as in agriculture. We say:
the English classical school, because on this point Adam Smith
himself occasionally relapses quietly into the Physiocrat point
of view. It is only Ricardo who develops the theory of the value
of labour as highly and logically as it could advance within the
limits of the bourgeois approach. The consequence is that we
must assume all capital investment to produce annual surplus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
value, in the manufacturing part of social production as a
whole no less than in agriculture.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the discovery of the productive, value-creating
property of every kind of labour, alike in agriculture
and in manufacture, suggested to Smith that agricultural
labour, too, must produce, apart from the rent for the landowning
class, a surplus for the tenant class over and above the
total of their capital expenses. Thus, in addition to the replacement
of capital, an annual income of the tenant class comes
into being.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Lastly, by a systematic elaboration of the concepts of <i>avances
primitives</i> and <i>avances annuelles</i> introduced by Quesnay, which he
calls fixed and circulating capital, Smith has made clear, among
other things, that the manufacturing side of social production
requires a fixed as well as a circulating capital. Thus he was
well on the way to restoring to order the concepts of capital and
revenue of society, and to describing them in precise terms. The
following exposition represents the highest level of clarity which
he achieved in this respect:</p>

<p>&#8216;Though the whole annual produce of the land and labour of
every country is, no doubt, ultimately destined for supplying the
consumption of its inhabitants and for procuring a revenue to
them, yet when it first comes either from the ground or from the
hands of the productive labourer, it naturally divides itself into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
two parts. One of them, and frequently the largest, is, in the first
place, destined for replacing a capital, or for renewing the provisions,
materials, and finished work, which had been withdrawn
from a capital; the other for constituting a revenue
either to the owner of this capital, as the profit of his stock, or
to some other person, as the rent of his land.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>&#8216;The gross revenue of all the inhabitants of a great country
comprehends the whole annual produce of their land and
labour; the neat revenue, what remains free to them after
deducting the expense of maintaining, first, their fixed, and
secondly, their circulating capital; or what, without encroaching
upon their capital, they can place in their stock reserved for
immediate consumption, or spend upon their subsistence, conveniencies,
and amusements. Their real wealth too is in proportion,
not to their gross, but to their neat revenue.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The concepts of total capital and income appear here in a
more comprehensive and stricter form than in the <i>Tableau
Économique</i>. The one-sided connection of social income with
agriculture is severed and social income becomes a broader
concept; and a broader concept of capital in its two forms, fixed
and circulating capital, is made the basis of social production as
a whole. Instead of the misleading differentiation of production
into two departments, agriculture and industry, other categories
of real importance are here brought to the fore: the distinction
between capital and income and the distinction, further,
between fixed and circulating capital.</p>

<p>Now Smith proceeds to a further analysis of the mutual relations
of these categories and of how they change in the course
of the social process, in production and circulation&mdash;in the reproductive
process of society. He emphasises here a radical
distinction between fixed and circulating capital from the point
of view of the society:</p>

<p>&#8216;The whole expense of maintaining the fixed capital must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
evidently be excluded from the neat revenue of the society.
Neither the materials necessary for supporting their useful
machines and instruments of trade, their profitable buildings,
etc., nor the produce of the labour necessary for fashioning
those materials into the proper form, can ever make any part of
it. The price of that labour may indeed make a part of it; as
the workmen so employed may place the whole value of their
wages in their stock reserved for immediate consumption. But
in other sorts of labour, both the price and the produce go to
this stock, the price to that of the workmen, the produce to that
of other people whose subsistence, convenience and amusements
are augmented by the labour of those workmen.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Here Smith comes up against the important distinction between
workers who produce means of production and those
who produce consumer goods. With regard to the former he
remarks that they create the value&mdash;destined to replace their
wages and to serve as their income&mdash;in the form of means of
production such as raw materials and instruments which in
their natural form cannot be consumed. With regard to the
latter category of workers, Smith observes that conversely the
total product, or better that part of value contained in it which
replaces the wages, the income of the workers together with its
other remaining value, appears here in the form of consumer
goods. (The real meaning latent in this conclusion, though
Smith does not say so explicitly, is that the part of the product
which represents the fixed capital employed in its production
appears likewise in this form.) In the further course of our
investigation we shall see how close Smith has here come to the
vantage point from which Marx tackled the problem. The
general conclusion, however, maintained by Smith without any
further examination of the fundamental question, is that, in any
case, whatever is destined for the preservation and renewal of
the fixed capital of society cannot be added to society&#8217;s net
income.</p>

<p>The position is different with regard to circulating capital.
&#8216;But though the whole expenses of maintaining the fixed capital
is thus necessarily excluded from the neat revenue of the
society, it is not the same case with that of maintaining the circulating
capital. Of the four parts of which this latter capital is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
composed, money, provisions, materials and finished work, the
three last, it has already been observed, are regularly withdrawn
from it and placed either in the fixed capital of the society, or
in their stock reserved for immediate consumption. Whatever
portion of those consumable goods is not employed in maintaining
the former, goes all to the latter, and makes a part of
the neat revenue of the society, besides what is necessary for
maintaining the fixed capital.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>We see that Smith here simply includes in this category of
circulating capital everything but the fixed capital already
employed, that is to say, foodstuffs and raw materials and in
part commodities which, according to their natural form, belong
to the replacement of fixed capital. Thus he has made the
concept of circulating capital vague and ambiguous. But a
further and most important distinction crops up and cuts right
through this conception: &#8216;The circulating capital of a society is
in this respect different from that of an individual. That of an
individual is totally excluded from making any part of his neat
revenue, which must consist altogether in his profits. But though
the circulating capital of every individual makes a part of that
of the society to which he belongs, it is not upon that account
totally excluded from making a part likewise of their neat
revenues.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>In the following illustration Smith expounds what he means:
&#8216;Though the whole goods in a merchant&#8217;s shop must by no
means be placed in his own stock reserved for immediate consumption,
they may in that of other people, who, from a
revenue derived from other funds, may regularly replace their
value to him, together with its profits, without occasioning any
diminution either of his capital or theirs.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Here Smith has established fundamental categories with
regard to the reproduction and movement of circulating social
capital. Fixed and circulating capital, private and social capital,
private and social revenue, means of production and consumer
goods, are marked out as comprehensive categories, and their
real, objective interrelation is partly indicated and partly
drowned in the subjective and theoretical contradictions of
Smith&#8217;s analysis. The concise, strict, and classically clear scheme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
of the Physiocrat theory is dissolved here into a disorderly
jumble of concepts and relations which at first glance appears
an absolute chaos. But we may already perceive new connections
within the social process of reproduction, understood by
Smith in a deeper, more modern and vital way than was within
Quesnay&#8217;s grasp, though, like Michelangelo&#8217;s slave in the unhewn
block of marble, they are still inchoate.</p>

<p>This is the only illustration Smith gives of this problem.
But at the same time he attacks it from another angle&mdash;by an
analysis of value. This very same theory which represents an
advance beyond the Physiocrats&mdash;the theory that it is an essential
quality of all labour to create value; the strictly capitalist
distinction between paid labour replacing wages, and unpaid
labour creating surplus value; and, finally, the strict division of
surplus value into its two main categories, of profit and rent&mdash;all
this progress from the analysis of the Physiocrats leads Smith
to the strange proposition that the price of every commodity
consists of wages, plus profits, plus rent, or, in Marx&#8217;s shorthand,
of <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>. In consequence, the commodities annually produced
by society as a whole can be resolved completely, as to
value, into the two components: wages and surplus value. Here
the category of capital has disappeared all of a sudden; society
produces nothing but income, nothing but consumer goods,
which it also consumes completely. Reproduction without
capital becomes a paradox, and the treatment of the problem
as a whole has taken an immense backward step against that of
the Physiocrats.</p>

<p>The followers of Adam Smith have tackled this twofold
theory from precisely the wrong approach. Before Marx nobody
concerned himself with the important beginnings of an exact
exposition of the problem in Smith&#8217;s second book, while most
of his followers jealously preserved Smith&#8217;s radically wrong
analysis of prices, accepting it, like Ricardo, without question,
or else, like Say, elaborating it into a trite doctrine. Where
Smith raised fruitful doubts and stimulating contradictions, Say
flaunted the opinionated presumption of a commonplace mind.
Smith&#8217;s observation that the capital of one person may be the
revenue of another induced Say to proclaim every distinction
between capital and income on the social scale to be absurd.
The absurdity, however, that income should completely absorb
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the total value of annual production which is thus consumed
completely, assumes in Say&#8217;s treatment the character of an
absolutely valid dogma. If society annually consumes its own
total product completely, social reproduction without any
means of production whatever must become an annual repetition
of the Miracle of the Creation.</p>

<p>In this state the problem of reproduction remained up to the
time of Karl Marx.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER III</i></h2>

<h2>A CRITICISM OF SMITH&#8217;S ANALYSIS</h2>

<p>Let us recapitulate the conclusions to which Smith&#8217;s
analysis has brought us:</p>

<p>(1) There is a fixed capital of society, no part of which
enters into its net revenue. This fixed capital consists in &#8216;the
materials necessary for supporting their useful machines and
instruments of trade&#8217; and &#8216;the produce of labour necessary for
fashioning those materials into the proper form&#8217;.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> By singling
out the production of such fixed capital as of a special kind, and
explicitly contrasting it with the production of consumer goods,
Smith in effect transformed fixed capital into what Marx calls
&#8216;constant capital&#8217;&mdash;that part of capital which consists of all
material means of production, as opposed to labour power.</p>

<p>(2) There is a circulating capital of society. After eliminating
the part of fixed, or constant, capital, there remains only the
category of consumer goods; these are not capital for society
but net revenue, a fund of consumption.</p>

<p>(3) Capital and net revenue of an individual do not strictly
correspond with capital and net revenue of society. What is
nothing but fixed, or constant capital for society as a whole
cannot be capital for the individual; it must be revenue, too, a
fund of consumption, comprising as it does those parts of fixed
capital which represent the workers&#8217; wages and the capitalists&#8217;
profits. On the other hand, the circulating capital of the individuals
cannot be capital for society but must be revenue, especially
in so far as it takes the form of provisions.</p>

<p>(4) As regards the value of the total annual social product, no
trace of capital remains. It can be resolved completely into the
three kinds of income: wages, profits of capital, and rents.</p>

<p>If we tried from this haphazard collection of odd ideas to
build up a picture of the annual reproduction of total social
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
capital, and of its mechanism, we should soon despair of our
task. Indeed, all these observations leave us infinitely remote
from the solution of the problem how social capital is annually
renewed, how everybody&#8217;s consumption is ensured by his
income, while the individuals can nevertheless adhere to their
own points of view on capital and income. Yet if we wish to
appreciate fully Marx&#8217;s contribution to the elucidation of this
problem, we must be fully aware of all this confusion of ideas,
the mass of conflicting points of view.</p>

<p>Let us begin with Adam Smith&#8217;s last thesis which alone would
suffice to wreck the treatment of the problem of reproduction in
classical economics.</p>

<p>Smith&#8217;s basic principle is that the total produce of society,
when we consider its value, resolves itself completely into wages,
profits and rents: this conception is deeply rooted in his scientific
theory that value is nothing but the product of labour. All
labour performed, however, is wage labour. This identification
of human labour with capitalist wage labour is indeed the
classical element in Smith&#8217;s doctrine. The value of the aggregate
product of society comprises both the recompense for wages
advanced and a surplus from unpaid labour appearing as profit
for the capitalist and rent for the landowner. What holds good
for the individual commodity must hold good equally for the
aggregate of commodities. The whole mass of commodities produced
by society&mdash;taken as a quantity of value&mdash;is nothing but
a product of labour, of paid as well as unpaid labour, and thus
it is also to be completely resolved into wages, profits, and rents.</p>

<p>It is of course true that raw materials, instruments, and the
like, must be taken into consideration in connection with all
labour. Yet is it not true also that these raw materials and instruments
in their turn are equally products of labour which
again may have been paid or unpaid? We may go back as far as
we choose, we may twist and turn the problem as much as we
like, yet we shall find no element in the value of any commodity&mdash;and
therefore none in the price&mdash;which cannot be resolved
purely in terms of human labour. We can distinguish, however,
two parts in all labour: one part repays the wages and the other
accrues to the capitalist and landlord. There seems nothing left
but wages and profits&mdash;and yet, there is capital, individual and
social capital. How can we overcome this blatant contradiction?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
The fact that Marx himself stubbornly pursued this matter for
a long time without getting anywhere at first as witness his
<i>Theories of the Surplus Value</i>,<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> proves that this theoretical problem
is indeed extremely hard to solve. Yet the solution he eventually
hit on was strikingly successful, and it is based upon his theory
of value. Adam Smith was perfectly right: nothing but labour
constitutes the value of the individual commodity and of the
aggregate of commodities. He was equally right in saying that
from a capitalist point of view all labour is either paid labour
which restores the wages, or unpaid labour which, as surplus
value, accrues to the various classes owning the means of production.
What he forgot, however, or rather overlooked, is the
fact that, apart from being able to create new value, labour
can also transfer to the new commodities the old values incorporated
in the means of production employed. A baker&#8217;s
working day of ten hours is, from the capitalist point of view,
divided into paid and unpaid hours, into <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>. But the commodity
produced in these ten hours will represent a greater
value than that of ten hours&#8217; labour, for it will also contain the
value of the flour, of the oven which is used, of the premises, of
the fuel and so on, in short the value of all the means of production
necessary for baking. Under one condition alone could the
value of any one commodity be strictly equal to <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>; if a man
were to work in mid-air, without raw materials, without tools or
workshop. But since all work on materials (material labour)
presupposes means of production of some sort which themselves
result from preceding labour, the value of this past labour is of
necessity transferred to the new product.</p>

<p>The process in question does not only take place in capitalist
production; it is the general foundation of human labour, quite
independent of the historical form of society. The handling of
man-made tools is a fundamental characteristic of human
civilisation. The concept of past labour which precedes all new
labour and prepares its basis, expresses the nexus between man
and nature evolved in the history of civilisation. This is the
eternal chain of closely interwoven labouring efforts of human
society, the beginnings of which are lost in the grey dawn of
the socialisation of mankind, and the termination of which
would imply the end of the whole of civilised mankind. Therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
we have to picture all human labour as performed with the
help of tools which themselves are already products of antecedent
labour. Every new product thus contains not only the
new labour whereby it is given its final form, but also past
labour which had supplied the materials for it, the instruments
of labour and so forth. In the production of value, that is commodity
production into which capitalist production also enters,
this phenomenon is not suspended, it only receives a particular
expression. Here the labour which produces commodities
assumes a twofold characteristic: it is on the one hand useful
concrete labour of some kind or other, creating the useful object,
the value-in-use. On the other hand, it is abstract, general,
socially necessary labour and as such creates value. In its first
aspect it does what labour has always done: it transfers to the
new product past labour, incorporated in the means of production
employed, with this distinction only, that this past labour,
too, now appears as value, as old value. In its second aspect,
labour creates new value which, in capitalist terms, can be
reduced to paid and unpaid labour, to <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>. Thus the value of
every commodity must contain old value which has been transferred
by labour <i>qua</i> useful concrete labour from the means of
production to the commodity, as well as the new value, created
by the same labour <i>qua</i> socially necessary labour merely as this
labour is expended hour by hour.</p>

<p>This distinction was beyond Smith: he did not differentiate
the twofold character of value-creating labour. Marx once
claimed to have discovered the ultimate source of Smith&#8217;s
strange dogma&mdash;that the aggregate of produced values can be
completely resolved into <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>&mdash;in his fundamentally erroneous
theory of value.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Failure to differentiate between the two aspects
of commodity-producing labour as concrete and useful labour
on the one hand, and abstract and socially necessary labour on
the other, indeed forms one of the most important characteristics
of the theory of value as conceived not only by Smith but by all
members of the classical school.</p>

<p>Disregarding all social consequences, classical economics recognised
that human labour alone is the factor which creates
value, and it worked out this theory to that degree of clarity
which we meet in Ricardo&#8217;s formulation. There is a fundamental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
distinction, however, between Marx&#8217;s theory of value
and Ricardo&#8217;s, a distinction which has been misunderstood not
only by bourgeois economists but also in most cases by the
popularisers of Marx&#8217;s doctrine: Ricardo, conceiving as he did,
of bourgeois economy in terms of natural law, believed also that
the creation of value, too, is a natural property of human labour,
of the specific and concrete labour of the individual human
being.</p>

<p>This view is even more blatantly revealed in the writings of
Adam Smith who for instance declares what he calls the &#8216;propensity
to exchange&#8217; to be a quality peculiar to human nature,
having looked for it in vain in animals, particularly in dogs.
And although he doubted the existence of the propensity to
exchange in animals, Smith attributed to animal as well as
human labour the faculty of creating value, especially when he
occasionally relapses into the Physiocrat doctrine:</p>

<p>&#8216;No equal capital puts into motion a greater quantity of productive
labour than that of the farmer. Not only his labouring
servants, but his labouring cattle, are productive labourers....&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>&#8216;The labourers and labouring cattle, therefore, employed in
agriculture, not only occasion, like the workmen in manufactures,
the reproduction of a value equal to their own consumption,
or to the capital which employs them, together with its
owner&#8217;s profits, but of a much greater value. Over and above
the capital of the farmer and all its profits, they regularly
occasion the reproduction of the rent of the landlord.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Smith&#8217;s belief that the creation of value is a direct physiological
property of labour, a manifestation of the animal
organism in man, finds its most vivid expression here. Just as the
spider produces its web from its own body, so labouring man
produces value&mdash;labouring man pure and simple, every man
who produces useful objects&mdash;because labouring man is by birth
a producer of commodities; in the same way human society
is founded by nature on the exchange of commodities, and a
commodity economy is the normal form of human economy.</p>

<p>It was left to Marx to recognise that a given value covers
a definite social relationship which develops under definite
historical conditions. Thus he came to discriminate between the
two aspects of commodity-producing labour: concrete individual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
labour and socially necessary labour. When this distinction
is made, the solution of the money problem becomes clear also,
as though a spotlight had been turned on it.</p>

<p>Marx had to establish a dynamic distinction in the course
of history between the commodity producer and the labouring
man, in order to distinguish the twin aspects of labour which
appear static in bourgeois economy. He had to discover that the
production of commodities is a definite historical form of social
production before he could decipher the hieroglyphics of capitalist
economy. In a word, Marx had to approach the problem
with methods of deduction diametrically opposed to those of the
classical school, he had in his approach to renounce the latter&#8217;s
faith in the human and normal element in bourgeois production
and to recognise their historical transience: he had to
reverse the metaphysical deductions of the classics into their
opposite, the dialectical.</p>

<p>On this showing Smith could not possibly have arrived at a
clear distinction between the two aspects of value-creating
labour, which on the one hand transfers the old value incorporated
in the means of production to the new product, and on
the other hand creates new value at the same time. Moreover,
there seems to be yet another source of his dogma that total
value can be completely resolved into <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>. We should be wrong
to assume that Smith lost sight of the fact that every commodity
produced contains not only the value created by its production,
but also the values incorporated in all the means of production
that had been spent upon it in the process of manufacturing it.
By the very fact that he continually refers us from one stage of
production to a former one&mdash;sending us, as Marx complains,
from pillar to post, in order to show the complete divisibility of
the aggregate value into <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>&mdash;Smith proves himself well aware
of the point. What is strange in this connection is that he again
and again resolves the old value of the means of production, too,
into <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>, so as finally to cover the whole value contained in the
commodity.</p>

<p>&#8216;In the price of corn, for example, one part pays the rent of
the landlord, another pays the wages of maintenance of the
labourers and labouring cattle employed in producing it, and
the third pays the profit of the farmer. These three parts (wages,
profit, and rent) seem either immediately or ultimately to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
up the whole price of corn. A fourth part, it may perhaps be
thought, is necessary for replacing the stock of the farmer, or for
compensating the wear and tear of his labouring cattle and
other instruments of husbandry. But it must be considered that
the price of any instrument of husbandry, such as a labouring
horse, is itself made up of the same three parts: the rent of the
land upon which he is reared, the labour of tending and rearing
him, and the profits of the farmer who advances both the rent
of this land and the wages of this labour. Though the price of
the corn, therefore, may pay the price as well as the maintenance
of the horse, the whole price still resolves itself either
immediately or ultimately into the same three parts of rent, of
labour, and profit.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>Apparently Smith&#8217;s confusion arose from the following premises:
first, that all labour is performed with the help of means
of production of some kind or other&mdash;yet what are these means
of production associated with any given labour (such as raw
materials and tools) if not the product of previous labour? Flour
is a means of production to which the baker adds new labour.
Yet flour is the result of the miller&#8217;s work, and in his hands it
was not a means of production but the very product, in the same
way as now the bread and pastries are the product of the baker.
This product, flour, again presupposes grain as a means of production,
and if we go one step further back, this corn is not a
means of production in the hands of the farmer but the product.
It is impossible to find any means of production in which
value is embodied, without it being itself the product of some
previous labour.</p>

<p>Secondly, speaking in terms of capitalism, it follows further
that all capital which has been completely used up in the manufacture
of any commodity, can in the end be resolved into a
certain quantity of performed labour.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the total value of the commodity, including all
capital advances, can readily be resolved in this manner into a
certain quantity of labour. What is true for every commodity,
must go also for the aggregate of commodities produced by a
society in the course of a year; its aggregate value can similarly
be resolved into a quantity of performed labour.</p>

<p>Fourthly, all labour performed under capitalist conditions is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
divided into two parts: paid labour which restores the wages
advanced, and unpaid labour which creates profit and rent, or
surplus value. All labour carried out under capitalist conditions
thus corresponds to our formula <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>All the arguments outlined above are perfectly correct and
unassailable. Smith handled them in a manner which proves
his scientific analysis consistent and undeviating, and his conceptions
of value and surplus value a distinct advance on the
Physiocrat approach. Only occasionally, in his third thesis, he
went astray in his final conclusion, saying that the aggregate
value of the annually produced aggregate of commodities can
be resolved into the labour of that very year, although he himself
had been acute enough to admit elsewhere that the value of
the commodities a nation produces in the course of one year
necessarily includes the labour of former years as well, that is the
labour embodied in the means of production which have been
handed down.</p>

<p>But even if the four statements enumerated are perfectly
correct in themselves, the conclusion Smith draws from them&mdash;that
the total value of every commodity, and equally of the
annual aggregate of commodities in a society, can be resolved
entirely into <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>&mdash;is absolutely wrong. He has the right idea
that the whole value of a commodity represents nothing but
social labour, yet identifies it with a false principle, that all
value is nothing but <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>. The formula <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> expresses the function
of living labour under capitalism, or rather its double
function, first to restore the wages, or the variable capital, and
secondly, to create surplus value for the capitalist. Wage labour
fulfils this function whilst it is employed by the capitalists, in
virtue of the fact that the value of the commodities is realised in
cash. The capitalist takes back the variable capital he had
advanced in form of wages, and he pockets the surplus value as
well. <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> therefore expresses the relation between wage labour
and capitalist, a relationship that is terminated in every instance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
as soon as the process of commodity production is finished. Once
the commodity is sold, and the relation <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> is realised for the
capitalist in cash, the whole relationship is wiped out and leaves
no traces on the commodity. If we examine the commodity and
its value, we cannot ascertain whether it has been produced by
paid or by unpaid labour, nor in what proportion these have
contributed. Only one fact is beyond doubt: the commodity
contains a certain quantity of socially necessary labour which is
expressed in its exchange. It is completely immaterial for the act
of exchange as well as for the use of the commodity whether the
labour which produced it could be resolved into <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> or not. In
the act of exchange all that matters is that the commodity represents
value, and only its concrete qualities, its usefulness, are
relevant to the use we make of it. Thus the formula <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> only
expresses, as it were, the intimate relationship between capital
and labour, the social function of wage labour, and in the
actual product this is completely wiped out. It is different with
the constant capital which has been advanced and invested in
means of production, because every activity of labour requires
certain raw materials, tools, and buildings. The capitalist character
of this state of affairs is expressed by the fact that these
means of production appear as capital, as <i>c</i>, the property of
a person other than the labourer, divorced from labour, the
property of those who themselves do not work. Secondly, the
constant capital <i>c</i>, a mere advance laid out for the purpose of
creating surplus value, appears here only as the foundation of
<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>. Yet the concept of constant capital involves more than
this: it expresses the function of the means of production in the
process of human labour, quite independently of all its historical
or social forms. Everybody must have raw materials and working
tools, the means of production, be it the South Sea Islander
for making his family canoe, the communist peasant community
in India for the cultivation of their communal land, the Egyptian
fellah for tilling his village lands or for building Pharaoh&#8217;s
pyramids, the Greek slave in the small workshops of Athens,
the feudal serf, the master craftsman of the medieval guild, or
the modern wage labourer. They all require means of production
which, having resulted from human labour, express the
link between human labour and natural matter, and constitute
the eternal and universal prerequisites of the human process of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
production. <i>c</i> in the formula <i>c</i>&nbsp;+ <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> stands for a certain function
of the means of production which is not wiped out in the succession
of the labour process. Whereas it is completely immaterial,
for both the exchange and the actual use made of a commodity,
whether it has been produced by paid or by unpaid labour, by
wage labour, slave labour, forced labour or any other kind of
labour; on the other hand, it is of decisive importance, as for
using it, whether the commodity is itself a means of production
or a consumer good. Whether paid or unpaid labour has been
employed in the production of a machine, matters to the machinery
manufacturer and to his workers, but only to them; for
society, when it acquires this machine by an act of exchange,
only the quality of this machine as a means of production, only
its function in the process of production is of importance. Just as
every producing society, since time immemorial, has had to give
due regard to the important function of the means of production
by arranging, in each period of production, for the manufacture
of the means of production requisite for the next period, so
capitalist society, too, cannot achieve its annual production of
value to accord with the formula <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>&mdash;which indicates the
exploitation of wage labour&mdash;unless there exists, as the result of
the preceding period, the quantity of means of production
necessary to make up the constant capital. This specific connection
of each past period of production with the period following
forms the universal and eternal foundation of the social process
of reproduction and consists in the fact that in every period
parts of the produce are destined to become the means of production
for the succeeding period: but this relation remained
hidden from Smith&#8217;s sight. He was not interested in means of
production in respect of their specific function within the process
to which they are applied; he was only concerned with them
in so far as they are like any other commodity, themselves the
product of wage labour that has been employed in a capitalist
manner. The specifically capitalist function of wage labour in
the productive process completely obscured for him the eternal
and universal function of the means of production within the
labour process. His narrow bourgeois approach overlooked completely
the general relations between man and nature underneath
the specific social relations between capital and wage
labour. Here, it seems, is the real source of Adam Smith&#8217;s strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
dogma, that the total value of the annual social product can be
resolved into <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>. He overlooked the fact that <i>c</i> as the first link
in the formula <i>c</i>&nbsp;+ <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> is the essential expression of the general
social foundation of exploitation of wage labour by capital.</p>

<p>We conclude that the value of every commodity must be expressed
by the formula <i>c</i>&nbsp;+ <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>. The question now arises how
far this formula applies to the aggregate of commodities within
a society. Let us turn to the doubts expressed by Smith on this
point, the statement that an individual&#8217;s fixed and circulating
capital and his revenue do not strictly correspond to the same
categories from the point of view of society. (Cf. above, <a href="#Page_64">p. 64</a>,
no. 3.) What is circulating capital for one person is not capital
for another, but revenue, as for instance capital advances for
wages. This statement is based upon an error. If the capitalist
pays wages to the workers, he does not abandon his variable
capital and let it stray into the workers&#8217; hands, to become their
income. He only exchanges the value-form of his variable
capital against its natural form, labour power. The variable
capital remains always in the hand of the capitalist, first as
money, and then as labour power, to revert to him later
together with the surplus value as the cash proceeds from the
commodities. The worker, on the other hand, never gains
possession of the variable capital. His labour power is never
capital to him, but it is his only asset, the power to work is the
only thing he possesses. Again, if he has sold it and taken a
money wage, this wage is for him not capital but the price of his
commodity which he has sold. Finally, the fact that the worker
buys provisions with the wages he has received, has no more
connection with the function this money once fulfilled as variable
capital in the hands of the capitalist, than has the private
use a vendor of a commodity can make of the money he has
obtained by a sale. It is not the capitalist&#8217;s variable capital
which becomes the workers&#8217; income, but the price of the
worker&#8217;s commodity &#8216;labour power&#8217; which he has sold, while the
variable capital, now as ever, remains in the hands of the capitalist
and fulfils its specific function. Equally erroneous is the
conception that the income of the capitalist (the surplus value)
which is hidden in machines&mdash;in our example of a machinery
manufacturer&mdash;which has not as yet been realised, is fixed
capital for another person, the buyer of the machines. It is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
the machines, or parts of them, which form the income of the
machinery manufacturer, but the surplus value that is hidden
in them&mdash;the unpaid labour of his wage labourers. After the
machine has been sold, this income simply remains as before in
the hand of the machinery manufacturer; it has only changed
its outward shape: it has been changed from the &#8216;machine-form&#8217;
into the &#8216;money-form&#8217;. Conversely, the buyer of this machine
has not, by its purchase, newly obtained possession of his fixed
capital, for he had this fixed capital in hand even before the
purchase, in the form of a certain amount of cash. By buying this
machine, he has only given to his capital the adequate material
form for it to become productive. The income, or surplus
value, remains in the hands of the machinery manufacturer
before and after the sale of the machine, and the fixed capital
remains in the hands of the other person, the capitalist buyer
of the machine, just as the variable capital in the first example
always remained in the hands of the capitalist and the income
in the hands of the worker.</p>

<p>Smith and his followers have caused confusion because, in
their investigation of capitalist exchange, they mixed up the use-form
of the commodities with their relations of value. Further,
they did not distinguish the individual circulations of capitals
and commodities which are ever interlacing. One and the same
act of exchange can be circulation of capital, when seen from
one aspect, and at the same time simple commodity exchange
for the purpose of consumption. The fallacy that whatever is
capital for one person must be income for another, and <i>vice
versa</i>, must be translated thus into the correct statement that
what is circulation of capital for one person, may be simple
commodity exchange for another, and <i>vice versa</i>. This only
expresses the capacity of capital to undergo transformations of
its character, and the interconnections of various spheres of
interest in the social process of exchange. The sharply outlined
existence of capital in contrast with income still stands in both
its clearly defined forms of constant and variable capital. Even
so, Smith comes very close to the truth when he states that
capital and income of the individual are not strictly identical
with the same categories from the point of view of the community.
Only a few further connecting links are lacking for a
clear revelation of the true relationship.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER IV</i></h2>

<h2>MARX&#8217;S SCHEME
OF SIMPLE REPRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Let us now consider the formula <i>c</i>&nbsp;+ <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> as the expression
of the social product as a whole. Is it only a theoretical
abstraction, or does it convey any real meaning when
applied to social life&mdash;has the formula any objective existence in
relation to society as a whole? It was left to Marx to establish the
fundamental importance of <i>c</i>, the constant capital, in economic
theory. Yet Adam Smith before him, working exclusively with
the categories of fixed and circulating capital, in effect transformed
this fixed capital into constant capital, though he was
not aware of having achieved this result. This constant capital
comprises not only those means of production which wear out
in the course of years, but also those which are completely
absorbed by production in any one year. His very dogma that
the total value is resolved into <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> and his arguments on this
point lead Smith to distinguish between the two categories of
production&mdash;living labour and inanimate means of production.
On the other hand, when he tries to construe the social process
of reproduction on the basis of the capitals and incomes of
individuals, the fixed capital he conceives of as existing apart
from these, is, in fact, constant capital.</p>

<p>Every individual capitalist uses for the production of his commodities
certain material means of production such as premises,
raw materials and instruments. In order to produce the aggregate
of commodities in a given society, an aggregate of all
material means of production used by the individual capitalists
is an obvious requisite. The existence of these means of production
within the society is a real fact, though they themselves
exist in the form of purely private individual capitals. This is the
universal absolute condition of social production in all its
historical forms.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
The specific capitalist form manifests itself in the fact that the
material means of production function as <i>c</i>, as constant capital,
the property of those who do not work; it is the opposite pole to
proletarianised labour power, the counterpart of wage labour.
The variable capital, <i>v</i>, is the aggregate of wages actually paid
in the society in the course of a year&#8217;s production. This fact, too,
has real objective existence, although it manifests itself in an
innumerable mass of individual wages. In every society the
amount of labour power actually engaged in production and the
annual maintenance of the workers is a question of decisive
importance. Where this factor takes the specific capitalist form
of <i>v</i>, the variable capital, it follows that the means of subsistence
first come to the workers in form of a wage which is the price of
the labour power they have sold to another person, the owner
of the material means of production who does not work himself;
under this aspect, it is the latter&#8217;s capitalist property. Further,
<i>v</i> is an aggregate of money, that is to say it is the means of subsistence
for the workers in a form of pure value. This concept of
<i>v</i> implies that the workers are free in a double sense&mdash;free in
person and free of all means of production. It also expresses the
fact that in a given society the universal form of production is
commodity production.</p>

<p>Finally, <i>s</i>, the surplus value, stands for the total of all surplus
values gained by the individual capitalists. Every society performs
surplus labour, and even a socialist society will have to do
the same. It must perform surplus labour in a threefold sense:
it has to provide a quantity of labour for the maintenance of
non-workers (those who are unable to work, such as children,
old people, invalids, and also civil servants and the so-called
liberal professions who do not take an immediate part in the
satisfaction of material<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>  wants), it has to provide a fund of social
insurance against elementary disasters which may threaten the
annual produce, such as bad harvests, forest fires and floods;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
and lastly it must provide a fund for the purpose of increasing
production, either because of an increase in the population, or
because higher standards of civilisation lead to additional wants.
It is in two respects that the capitalist character manifests itself:
surplus labour comes into being (1) as surplus value, i.e. in
commodity-form, realisable in cash, and (2) as the property of
non-workers, of those who own the means of production.</p>

<p>Similarly, if we consider <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>, these two amounts taken
together, we see that they represent objective quantities of
universal validity: the total of living labour that has been performed
within a society in the course of one year. Every human
society, whatever its historical form, must take note of this
datum, with reference to both the results that have been
achieved, and the existing and available labour power. The
division into <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> is a universal phenomenon, independent of the
society&#8217;s particular historical form. In its capitalist form, this
division shows itself not only in the qualitative peculiarities of
both <i>v</i> and <i>s</i> as already outlined, but also in their quantitative
relationship: <i>v</i> tends to become depressed to a minimum level,
just sufficient for the physiological and social existence of the
worker, and <i>s</i> tends to increase continually at the cost of, and
relative to, <i>v</i>.</p>

<p>The predominant feature of capitalist production is expressed
in this last circumstance: it is the fact that the creation and
appropriation of surplus value is the real purpose of, and the
incentive to, production.</p>

<p>We have examined the relations upon which the capitalist
formula of the aggregate product is based, and have found them
universally valid. In every planned economy they are made the
object of conscious regulation on the part of society; in a communist
society by the community of workers and their democratic
organs, and in a society based upon class-rule by the
nucleus of owners and their despotic power. In a system of
capitalist production there is no such planned regulation. The
aggregate of the society&#8217;s capitals and the aggregate of its commodities
alike consist in reality of innumerable fragments of
individual capitals and individual items of merchandise, taken
together.</p>

<p>Thus the question arises whether these sums themselves mean
anything more in a capitalist society than a mere statistical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
enumeration which is, moreover, inexact and fluid. Applying
the standards of society as a whole, we perceive that the
completely independent and sovereign individual existence of
private enterprises is only the historically conditioned form,
whereas it is social interconnections that provide the foundation.
Although individual capitals act in complete independence
of one another, and a social regulation is completely lacking, the
movement of capitals forms a homogeneous whole. This movement,
too, appears in specifically capitalist forms. In every
planned system of production it is, above all, the relation between
all labour, past and present, and the means of production
(between <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> and <i>c</i>, according to our formula), or the relation
between the aggregate of necessary consumer goods (again, in
the terms of our formula, <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>) and <i>c</i> which are subjected to
regulation. Under capitalist conditions, on the other hand, all
social labour necessary for the maintenance of the inanimate
means of production and also of living labour power is treated
as one entity, as capital, in contrast with the surplus labour that
has been performed, i.e. with the surplus value <i>s</i>. The relation
between these two quantities <i>c</i> and (<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>) is a palpably real,
objective relationship of capitalist society: it is the average rate
of profit; every capital is in fact treated only as part of a common
whole, the whole of social capital, and assigned the profit to
which it is entitled, according to its size, out of the surplus value
wrested from society, regardless of the quantity which this
particular capital has actually created. Thus social capital and
its counterpart, the whole of social surplus value, are not merely
real quantities, having an objective existence, but, what is more,
the relation between them, the average profit, guides and directs
the whole process of exchange. This it does in three ways:
(1) by the mechanism of the law of value which establishes the
quantitative relations of exchange between the individual kinds
of commodities independently of their specific value relationship;
(2) by the social division of labour, the assignment of
certain portions of capital and labour to the individual spheres
of production; (3) by the development of labour productivity
which on the one hand stimulates individual capitals to engage
in pioneering work for the purpose of securing a higher profit
than the average, and on the other hand extends the progress
that has been achieved by individuals over the whole field of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
production. By means of the average rate of profit, in a word,
the total capital of society completely governs the seemingly
independent motions of individual capitals.</p>

<p>The formula <i>c</i>&nbsp;+ <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> thus applies to the aggregate of commodities
produced in a society under capitalism no less than
to the value composition of every individual commodity. It is,
however, only the value-composition for which this holds good&mdash;the
analogy cannot be carried further.</p>

<p>The formula is indeed perfectly exact if we regard the total
product of a capitalistically producing society as the output of
one year&#8217;s labour, and wish to analyse it into its respective components.
The quantity <i>c</i> shows how much of the labour of former
years has been taken over towards the product of the present
year in the form of means of production. Quantities <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> show
the value components of the product created by new labour
during the last year only; the relation between <i>v</i> and <i>s</i> finally
shows us how the annual labour programme of society is apportioned
to the two tasks of maintaining the workers and
maintaining those who do not work. This analysis remains valid
and correct also with regard to the reproduction of individual
capital, no matter what may be the material form of the product
this capital has created. All three, <i>c</i>, <i>v</i>, and <i>s</i>, appear alike to a
capitalist of the machinery industry in the form of machinery
and its parts; to the owner of a music hall they are represented
by the charms of the dancers and the skill of the acrobats. So
long as the product is left undifferentiated, <i>c</i>, <i>v</i>, and <i>s</i> differ from
one another only in so far as they are <i>aliquot</i> components of
value. This is quite sufficient for the reproduction of individual
capital, as such reproduction begins with the value-form of
capital, a certain amount of money that has been gained by the
realisation of the manufactured product. The formula <i>c</i>&nbsp;+ <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>
then is the given basis for the division of this amount of money;
one part for the purchase of the material means of production,
a second part for the purchase of labour power, and a third part&mdash;in
the case of simple reproduction assumed in the first instance&mdash;for
the capitalist&#8217;s personal consumption. In the case of
expanding reproduction part three is further subdivided, only a
fraction of it being devoted to the capitalist&#8217;s personal consumption,
the remainder to increasing his capital. In order to reproduce
his capital actually, the capitalist must, of course, turn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
again to the commodity market with the capital he has divided
in this manner, so that he can acquire the material prerequisites
of production such as raw materials, instruments, and so on. It
seems a matter of course to the individual capitalist as well as to
his scientific ideologist, the &#8216;vulgar economist&#8217;, that he should in
fact find there just those means of production and labour power
he needs for his business.</p>

<p>The position is different as regards the total production of
a society. From the point of view of society as a whole, the
exchange of commodities can only effect a shifting around,
whereby the individual parts of the total product change hands.
The material composition of the product, however, cannot be
changed by this process. After this change of places, as well as
before it, there can be reproduction of total capital, if, and only
if, there is in the total product of the preceding period: first,
a sufficient quantity of means of production, secondly, adequate
provisions to maintain the same amount of labour as hitherto,
and, last but not least, the goods necessary to maintain the
capitalist class and its hangers-on in a manner suitable to their
station. This brings us to a new plane: we are now concerned
with material points of view instead of pure relations of value.
It is the use-form of the total social product that matters now.
What the individual capitalist considers nobody else&#8217;s business
becomes a matter of grave concern for the totality of capitalists.
Whereas it does not make the slightest difference to the individual
capitalist whether he produces machinery, sugar, artificial
manure or a progressive newspaper&mdash;provided only that he can
find a buyer for his commodity so that he can get back his
capital plus surplus value&mdash;it matters infinitely to the &#8216;total
capitalist&#8217; that his total product should have a definite use-form.
By that we mean that it must provide three essentials: the means
of production to renew the labour process, simple provisions for
the maintenance of the workers, and provisions of higher quality
and luxury goods for the preservation of the &#8216;total capitalist&#8217;
himself. His desire in this respect is not general and vague, but
determined precisely and quantitatively. If we ask what quantities
of all three categories are required by the &#8216;total capitalist&#8217;,
the value-composition of last year&#8217;s total product gives us a
definite estimate, as long, that is, as we confine ourselves to
simple reproduction, which we have taken for our starting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
point. Hitherto we have conceived of the formula <i>c</i>&nbsp;+ <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> as a
merely quantitative division of the total value, applicable alike
to total capital and to individual capital, and representing the
quantity of labour contained in the annual product of society.
Now we see that the formula is also the basis of the material
composition of the product. Obviously the &#8216;total capitalist&#8217;, if
he is to take up reproduction to the same extent as before, must
find in his new total product as many means of production as
correspond to the size of <i>c</i>, as many simple provisions for the
workers as correspond to the sum of wages <i>v</i>, and as many provisions
of better quality for himself and his hangers-on as correspond
to <i>s</i>. In this way our analysis of the value of the society&#8217;s
aggregate product is translated into a general recipe for this
product as follows: the total <i>c</i> of society must be re-embodied
in an equal quantity of means of production, the <i>v</i> in provisions
for the workers, and the <i>s</i> in provisions for the capitalists, in
order that simple reproduction may take place.</p>

<p>Here we come up against palpable differences between the
individual capitalist and the total capitalist. The manner in
which the former always reproduces his constant and variable
capital as well as his surplus value is such that all three parts
are contained in the same material form within his homogeneous
product, that this material form, moreover, is completely irrelevant
and may have different qualities in the case of each
individual capitalist. The &#8216;total capitalist&#8217;, for his part, reproduces
every component of the value of his annual product in a
different material form, <i>c</i> as means of production, <i>v</i> as provisions
for the workers, and <i>s</i> as provisions for the capitalists. In the
case of the reproduction of individual capitals, there is no discrepancy
between relations of value and material points of view.
Besides, it is quite clear that individual capital may concentrate
on aspects of value, accepting material conditions as a law from
heaven, as self-evident phenomena of commodity-exchange,
whereas the &#8216;total capitalist&#8217; has to reckon with material points
of view. If the total <i>c</i> of society were not reproduced annually
in the form of an equal amount of means of production, every
individual capitalist would be doomed to search the commodity
market in vain with his <i>c</i> realised in cash, unable to find the
requisite materials for his individual reproduction. From the
point of view of reproducing the total capital, the formula
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
<i>c</i>&nbsp;+ <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> is inadequate. This again is proof of the fact that the
concept of total capital is something real and does not merely
paraphrase the concept of production. We must, however, make
general distinctions in our exposition of total capital: instead of
showing it as a homogeneous whole, we must demonstrate its
three main categories; and we shall not vitiate our theory if, for
the sake of simplicity, we consider for the present only two
departments of total capital: the production of producer goods,
and that of consumer goods for workers and capitalists. We have
to examine each department separately, adhering to the fundamental
conditions of capitalist production in each case. At the
same time, we must also emphasise the mutual connections between
these two departments from the point of view of reproduction.
For only if each is regarded in connection with the
other, do they make up the basis of the social capital as a whole.</p>

<p>We made a start by investigating individual capital. But we
must approach the demonstration of total capital and its total
product in a somewhat different manner. Quantitatively, as a
quantity of value, the <i>c</i> of society consists precisely in the total of
individual constant capitals, and the same applies to the other
amounts, <i>v</i> and <i>s</i>. But the outward shape of each has changed&mdash;the
<i>c</i> of constant capitals re-emerges from the process of production
as an element of value with infinitely varied facets,
comprising a host of variegated objects for use, but in the total
product it appears, as it were, contracted into a certain quantity
of means of production. Similarly with <i>v</i> and <i>s</i>, which in the case
of the individual capitalist re-emerge as items in a most colourful
jumble of commodities, being provisions in adequate quantities
for the workers and capitalists. Adam Smith came very close to
recognising this fact when he observed that the categories of
fixed and circulating capital and of revenue in relation to the
individual capitalist do not coincide with these categories in the
case of society.</p>

<p>We have come to the following conclusions:</p>

<p>(1) The formula <i>c</i>&nbsp;+ <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> serves to express the production of
society viewed as a whole, as well as the production of individual
capitalists.</p>

<p>(2) Social production is divided into two departments,
engaged in the production of producer and consumer goods
respectively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
(3) Both departments work according to capitalist methods,
that is to say they both aim at the production of surplus value,
and thus the formula <i>c</i>&nbsp;+ <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> will apply to each of them.</p>

<p>(4) The two departments are interdependent, and are therefore
bound to display a certain quantitative relationship, namely
the one department must produce all means of production, the
other all provisions for the workers and capitalists of both
departments.</p>

<p>Proceeding from this point of view, Marx devised the following
diagram of capitalist reproduction:</p>

<p>The figures in this diagram express quantities of value,
amounts of money which are chosen arbitrarily, but their ratios
are exact. Each department is characterised by the use-form of
the commodities produced. Their mutual circulation takes place
as follows: Department I supplies the means of production for
the entire productive process, for itself as well as for Department
II. From this alone it follows that for the undisturbed
continuance of reproduction&mdash;for we still presume simple reproduction
on the old scale&mdash;the total produce of Department I
(I 6,000) must have the same value as the sum of constant
capitals in both departments: (I 4,000<i>c</i>&nbsp;+ II 2,000<i>c</i>). Similarly,
Department II supplies provisions for the whole of society, for
its own workers and capitalists as well as for the workers and
capitalists of Department I. Hence it follows that for the undisturbed
course of consumption and production and its renewal
on the old scale it is necessary that the total quantity of provisions
supplied by Department II should equal in value all
the incomes of the employed workers and capitalists of society
[here II 3,000&nbsp;= I(1,000<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ 1,000<i>s</i>)&nbsp;+ II(500<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ 500<i>s</i>)].</p>

<p>Here we have indeed expressed relationships of value which
are the foundation not only of capitalist reproduction but of
reproduction in every society. In every producing society, whatever
its social form, in the primitive small village community of
the Bakairi of Brazil, in the <i>oikos</i> of a Timon of Athens with its
slaves, or in the imperial <i>corvée</i> farm of Charlemagne, the labour
power available for society must be distributed in such a way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
that means of production as well as provisions are produced in
adequate quantities. The former must suffice for the immediate
production of provisions as well as for the future renewal of the
means of production themselves, and the provisions in their turn
must suffice for the maintenance of the workers occupied in the
production alike of these same provisions and of the means of
production, and moreover for the maintenance of all those who
do not work.</p>

<p>In its broad outline, Marx&#8217;s scheme corresponds with the
universal and absolute foundation of social reproduction, with
only the following specifications: socially necessary labour
appears here as value, the means of production as constant
capital, the labour necessary for the maintenance of the workers
as variable capital and that necessary for the maintenance of
those who do not work as surplus value.</p>

<p>In capitalist society, however, the connections between these
two great departments depend upon exchange of commodities,
on the exchange of equivalents. The workers and capitalists of
Department I can only obtain as many provisions from Department
II as they can deliver of their own commodities, the
means of production. The demand of Department II for means
of production, on the other hand, is determined by the size of its
constant capital. It follows therefore that the sum of the variable
capital and of the surplus value in the production of producer
goods [here I(1,000<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ 1,000<i>s</i>)] must equal the constant capital
in the production of provisions [here II(2,000<i>c</i>)].</p>

<p>An important proviso remains to be added to the above
scheme. The constant capital which has been spent by the two
departments is in reality only part of the constant capital used
by society. This constant capital is divided into two parts; the
first is fixed capital&mdash;premises, tools, labouring cattle&mdash;which
functions in a number of periods of production, in every one of
which, however, only part of its value is absorbed by the product,
according to the amount of its wear and tear. The second
is circulating capital such as raw materials, auxiliary semi-finished
products, fuel and lighting&mdash;its whole value is completely
absorbed by the new product in every period of production.
Yet only that part of the means of production is relevant
for reproduction which is actually absorbed by the production
of value; without becoming less correct, an exact exposition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
social circulation may disregard the remaining part of the fixed
capital which has not been absorbed by the product, though it
should not completely forget it. This is easy to prove.</p>

<p>Let us assume that the constant capital, 6,000<i>c</i>, in the two
departments, which is in fact absorbed by the annual product
of these departments, consists of 1,500<i>c</i> fixed and 4,500<i>c</i> circulating
capital, the 1,500<i>c</i> of fixed capital representing here the
annual wear and tear of the premises, machinery and labouring
cattle. This annual wear and tear equals, say, 10 per cent of
the total value of the fixed capital employed. Then the total
social capital would really consist of 19,500<i>c</i>&nbsp;+ 1,500<i>v</i>, the constant
capital in both departments being 1,500<i>c</i> of fixed and
4,500<i>c</i> of circulating capital. Since the term of life of the
aggregate fixed capital, with a 10 per cent wear and tear, is
ten years <i>ex hypothesi</i>, the fixed capital needs renewal only after
the lapse of ten years. Meanwhile one-tenth of its value enters
into social production in every year. If all the fixed capital of
a society, with the same rate of wear and tear, were of equal
durability, it would, on our assumption, need complete renewal
once within ten years. This, however, is not the case. Some of
the various use-forms which are part of the fixed capital may
last longer and others shorter, wear and tear and duration of
life are quite different in the different kinds and individual
representations of fixed capital. In consequence, fixed capital
need not be renewed&mdash;reproduced in its concrete use-form&mdash;all
at once, but parts of it are continually renewed at various stages
of social production, while other parts still function in their
older form. Our assumption of a fixed capital of 15,000<i>c</i> with
a 10 per cent rate of wear and tear does not mean that this must
be renewed all at once every ten years, but that an annual
average renewal and replacement must be effected of a part
of the total fixed social capital corresponding to one-tenth of its
value; that is to say, Department I which has to satisfy the needs
of society for means of production must reproduce, year by year
not only all its raw and partly finished materials, etc., its circulating
capital to the value of 4,500, but must also reproduce the
use-forms of its fixed capital&mdash;premises, machinery, and the like&mdash;to
the extent of 1,500, corresponding with the annual wear
and tear of fixed capital. If Department I continues in this manner
to renew one-tenth of the fixed capital in its use-form every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
year, the result will be that every ten years the total fixed capital
of society will have been replaced throughout by new items;
thus it follows that the reproduction of those parts disregarded
so far is also completely accounted for in the above scheme.</p>

<p>In practice, the procedure is that every capitalist sets aside
from his annual production, from the realisation of his commodities,
a certain amount for the redemption of his fixed
capital. These individual annual deductions must amount to a
certain quantity of capital, therefore the capitalist has in fact
renewed his fixed capital, that is, he has replaced it by new and
more efficient items. This alternating procedure of building up
annual reserves of money for the renewal of fixed capital and
of the periodical employment of the accumulated amounts for
the actual renewal of fixed capital varies with the individual
capitalist, so that some are accumulating reserves, while others
have already started their renewals. Thus every year part of the
fixed capital is actually renewed. The monetary procedure here
only disguises the real process which characterises the reproduction
of fixed capital.</p>

<p>On closer observation we see that this is as it should be. The
whole of the fixed capital takes part in the process of production,
for physically the mass of usable objects, premises, machinery,
labouring cattle, are completely employed. It is their peculiarity
as fixed capital, on the other hand, that only part of the value is
absorbed in the production of value, since in the process of
reproduction (again postulating simple reproduction), all that
matters is to replace in their natural form the values which have
been actually used up as means of subsistence and production
during a year&#8217;s production. Therefore, fixed capital need only
be reproduced to the extent that it has in fact been used up in
the production of commodities. The remaining portion of value,
embodied in the total use-form of fixed capital, is of decisive
importance for production as a labour process, but does not
exist for the annual reproduction of society as a process of
value-formation.</p>

<p>Besides, this process which is here expressed by relations of
value applies equally to every society, even to a community
which does not produce commodities. If once upon a time, for
instance, say ten years&#8217; labour of 1,000 fellaheen was required
for the construction of the famous Lake Moeris and the related
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Nile canals&mdash;that miraculous lake, which Herodotus tells us was
made by hand&mdash;and if for the maintenance of this, the most
magnificent drainage system of the world, the labour of a further
100 fellaheen was annually required (the figures, of course, are
chosen at random), we might say that after every hundred years
the Moeris dam and the canals were reproduced anew, although
in fact the entire system was not constructed as a whole in every
century. This is manifestly true. When, amid the stormy incidents
of political history and alien conquests, the usual crude
neglect of old monuments of culture set in&mdash;as displayed, e.g. by
the English in India when the reproductional needs of ancient
civilisations were understood no longer&mdash;then in the course of
time the whole Lake Moeris, its water, dikes and canals, the two
pyramids in its midst, the colossus upon it and other marvellous
erections, disappeared without a trace, as though they had never
been built. Only ten lines in Herodotus, a dot on Ptolemy&#8217;s map
of the world, traces of old cultures, and of villages and cities
bear witness that at one time rich life sprang from this magnificent
irrigation system, where to-day there are only stretches of
arid desert in inner Lybia, and desolate swamps along the coast.
There is only one point where Marx&#8217;s scheme of simple reproduction
may appear unsatisfactory or incomplete in relation to
constant capital, and that is when we go back to that period of
production, when the total fixed capital was first created.
Indeed, society possesses transformed labour amounting to more
than those parts of fixed capital which are absorbed into the
value of the annual product and are in turn replaced by it. In
the figures of our example the total social capital does not consist
of 6,000<i>c</i>&nbsp;+ 1,500<i>v</i>, as in the diagram, but of 19,500<i>c</i>&nbsp;+ 1,500<i>v</i>.
Though 1,500 of the fixed capital (which, on our assumption,
amounts to 15,000) are annually reproduced in the form of
appropriate means of production, an equal amount is also consumed
by the same production each year, though the whole of
the fixed capital as a use-form, an aggregate of objects, has been
renewed. After ten years, society possesses in the eleventh, just
as in any other year, a fixed capital of 15,000, whereas it has
annually achieved only 1,500<i>c</i>; and its constant capital as a
whole is 19,500, whereas it has created only 6,000. Obviously,
since it must have created this surplus of 13,500 fixed capital by
its labour, it possesses more accumulated past labour than our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
scheme of reproduction warrants. Even at this stage, the annual
labour of society must be based on some previous annual labour
that has been hoarded. This question of past labour, however,
as the foundation of all present labour, brings us to the very first
beginning which is as meaningless with regard to the economic
development of mankind as it is for the natural development of
matter. The scheme of reproduction grasps the social process as
perpetually in motion, as a link in the endless chain of events,
it neither wants to demonstrate its initial origin, nor should it do
so. The social reproductive process is always based on past
labour, we may trace it back as far as we like. Social labour has
no beginning, just as it has no end. Like the historical origin of
Herodotus&#8217; Lake Moeris, the beginnings of the reproductive
process in the history of civilisation are lost in the twilight
of legend. With the progress of techniques and with cultural
development, the means of production change their form, crude
paleoliths are replaced by sharpened tools, stone implements
by elegant bronze and iron, the artisan&#8217;s tool by steam-driven
machinery. Yet, though the means of production and the social
organisation of the productive process continually change their
form, society already possesses for its labour process a certain
amount of past labour serving as the basis for annual
reproduction.</p>

<p>Under capitalist methods of production past labour of society
preserved in the means of production takes the form of capital,
and the question of the origin of this past labour which forms the
foundation of the reproductive process becomes the question of
the genesis of capital. This is much less legendary, indeed it is
writ in letters of blood in modern history. The very fact, however,
that we cannot think of simple reproduction unless we
assume a hoard of past labour, surpassing in volume the labour
annually performed for the maintenance of society, touches the
sore spot of simple reproduction; and it shows that simple reproduction
is a fiction not only for capitalist production but also for
the progress of civilisation in general. If we merely wish to
understand this fiction properly, and to reduce it to a scheme,
we must presume, as its <i>sine qua non</i>, results of a past productive
process which cannot possibly be restricted to simple reproduction
but inexorably points towards enlarged reproduction. By
way of illustration, we might compare the aggregate fixed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
capital of society with a railway. The durability and consequently
the annual wear and tear of its various parts is very
different. Parts such as viaducts and tunnels may last for centuries,
steam engines for decades, but other rolling stock will be
used up in a short time, in some instances in a few months. Yet
it is possible to work out an average rate of wear and tear, say
thirty years, so that the value of the whole is annually depreciated
by one thirtieth. This loss of value is now continually made
good by partial reproduction of the railway (which may count
as repairs), so that a coach is renewed to-day, part of the engine
to-morrow, and a section of sleepers the day after. On our
assumption then, the old railway is replaced by a new one after
thirty years, a similar amount of labour being performed each
year by the society so that simple reproduction takes place. But
the railway can only be reproduced in this manner&mdash;it cannot
be so produced. In order to make it fit for use and to make
good its gradual wear and tear, the railway must have been
completed in the first place. Though the railway can be repaired
in parts, it cannot be made fit for use piecemeal, an axle
to-day and a coach to-morrow. Indeed, the very essence of fixed
capital is always to enter into the productive process in its
entirety, as a material use-value. In order to get this use-form
ready in the first place, society must apply a more concentrated
amount of labour to its manufacture. In terms of our example,
the labour of thirty years that is used for repairs, must be compressed
into, say, two or three years. During this period of
manufacture, society must therefore expend an amount of
labour far greater than the average, that is to say it must have
recourse to expanding reproduction; later, when the railway is
finished, it may return to simple reproduction. Though we need
not visualise the aggregate fixed capital as a single coherent use-object
or a conglomeration of objects which must be produced
all at once, the manufacture of all the more important means of
production, such as buildings, transport facilities, and agricultural
structures, requires a more concentrated application of
labour, and this is true for the modern railway or steamship as
much as it was for the rough stone-axe and the handmill. Therefore
it is only in theory that simple reproduction can be conceived
as alternating with enlarged reproduction; the latter is
not only a general condition of a progressive civilisation and an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
expanding population, but also the <i>sine qua non</i> for the economic
form of fixed capital, or those means of production which in
every society correspond to the fixed capital.</p>

<p>Marx deals with this conflict between the formation of fixed
capital and simple reproduction but indirectly, in connection
with fluctuations in the wear and tear of the fixed capital, more
rapid in some years than in others. Here he emphasises the need
for perpetual &#8216;over-production&#8217;, i.e. enlarged reproduction,
since a strict policy of simple reproduction would periodically
lead to reproductive losses. In short, he regards enlarged reproduction
under the aspect of an insurance fund for the fixed
capital of the society, rather than in the light of the actual productive
process.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>In quite a different context Marx appears to endorse the
opinion expressed above. In <i>Theories on the Surplus Value</i>, vol ii,
part 2, analysing the conversion of revenue into capital, he
speaks of the peculiar reproduction of the fixed capital, the replacement
of which in itself already provides a fund for accumulation.
He draws the following conclusion:</p>

<p>&#8216;The point we have in mind is as follows: even if the aggregate
capital employed in machine manufacture were just large
enough to make good the annual wear and tear of the machines,
many more machines could be annually produced than are required,
since the wear and tear is in parts merely <i>idealiter</i> and
must be made good <i>realiter</i>, <i>in natura</i>, only after a certain number
of years. Capital so employed supplies each year a mass of
machinery which becomes available for, and anticipates new,
capital investments. Let us suppose, for instance, a machine
manufacturer who starts production this year. During this year,
he supplies machines for £12,000. If he were merely to reproduce
the machines he has manufactured, he would have to
produce, during the subsequent eleven years, machines for
£1,000 only, and even then, a year&#8217;s production would not be
consumed within the year. Still less could it be consumed, if he
were to employ the whole of his capital. To keep this capital
working, to keep it reproducing itself every year, a new and
continuous expansion of the branches of manufacture that require
these machines, is indispensable. This applies even more,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
if the machine manufacturer himself accumulates. In consequence,
even <i>if the capital invested in one particular branch of production
is simply being reproduced</i>,<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>  a continuous accumulation in
the other branches of production must go with it.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>We might take the machine manufacturer of Marx&#8217;s example
as illustrating the production of fixed capital. Then the inference
is that if society maintains simple reproduction in this
sphere, employing each year a similar amount of labour for the
production of fixed capital (a procedure which is, of course,
impossible in practical life), then annual production in all other
spheres must expand. But if here, too, simple reproduction is to
be maintained, then, if the fixed capital once created is to be
merely renewed, only a small part of the labour employed in its
creation can be expended. Or, to put it the other way round:
if society is to provide for investment in fixed capital on a large
scale, it must, even assuming simple reproduction to prevail on
the whole, resort periodically to enlarged reproduction.</p>

<p>With the advance of civilisation, there are changes not only in
the form of the means of production but also in the quantity
of value they represent&mdash;or better, changes in the social labour
stored up in them. Apart from the labour necessary for its
immediate preservation, society has increasingly more labour
time and labour power to spare, and it makes use of these for the
manufacture of means of production on an ever increasing scale.
How does this affect the process of reproduction? How, in terms
of capitalism, does society create out of its annual labour a
<i>greater</i> amount of capital than it formerly possessed? This question
touches upon enlarged reproduction, and it is not yet time
to deal with it.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER V</i></h2>

<h2>THE CIRCULATION OF MONEY</h2>

<p>In our study of the reproductive process we have not so far
considered the circulation of money. Here we do not refer to
money as a measuring rod, an embodiment of value, because
all relations of social labour have been expressed, assumed and
measured in terms of money. What we have to do now is to test
our diagram of simple reproduction under the aspect of money
as a means of exchange.</p>

<p>Quesnay already saw that we shall only understand the social
reproductive process if we assume, side by side with the means of
production and consumer goods, a certain quantity of money.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Two questions now arise: (1) by whom should the money be
owned, and (2) how much of it should there be? The answer to
the first question, no doubt, is that the workers receive their
wages in the form of money with which they buy consumer
goods. From the point of view of society, this means merely that
the workers are allocated a certain share of the fund for consumption:
every society, whatever its historical form of production,
makes such allocations to its workers. It is, however, an
essential characteristic of the capitalist form of production that
the workers do not obtain their share directly in the form of
goods but by way of commodity exchange, just as it is an essential
feature of the capitalist mode of production that their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
labour power is not applied directly, as a result of a relation of
personal domination, but again by way of commodity exchange:
the workers selling their labour power to the owners of the
means of production, and purchasing freely their consumer
goods. Variable capital in its money form is the expression and
medium of both these transactions.</p>

<p>Money, then, comes first into circulation by the payment of
wages. The capitalist class must therefore set a certain quantity
of money circulating in the first place, and this must be equal to
the amount they pay in wages. The capitalists of Department I
need 1,000 units of money, and the capitalists of Department II
need 500 to meet their wages bill. Thus, according to our
diagram, two quantities of money are circulating: I(1,000<i>v</i>) and
II(500<i>v</i>). The workers spend the total of 1,500 on consumer
goods, i.e. on the products of Department II. In this way,
labour power is maintained, that is to say the variable capital
of society is reproduced in its natural form, as the foundation of
all other reproductions of capital. At the same time, the capitalists
of Department II dispose of their aggregate product
(1,500) in the following manner: their own workers receive 500
and the workers of Department I receive 1,000. This exchange
gives the capitalists of Department II possession of 1,500 money
units: 500 are their own variable capital which has returned to
them; these may start circulating again as variable capital but
for the time being they have completed their course. The other
1,000 accrue to them year by year out of the realisation of one-third
of their own products. The capitalists of Department II
now buy means of production from the capitalists of Department
I for these 1,000 money units in order to renew the part
of their own constant capital that has been used up. By means
of this purchase, Department II renews in its natural form half
of the constant capital II<i>c</i> it requires. Department I now has
in return 1,000 money units which are nothing more than the
money originally paid to its own workers. Now, after having
changed hands twice, the money has returned to Department I,
to become effective later as variable capital. This completes the
circulation of this quantity of money for the moment, but the
circulation within society has not yet come to an end. The
capitalists of Department I have not yet realised their surplus
value to buy consumer goods for themselves; it is still contained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
in their product in a form which is of no use to them. Moreover,
the capitalists of Department II have not yet renewed the
second half of their constant capital. These two acts of exchange
are identical both in substance and in value, for the capitalists
of Department I receive their goods from Department II in
exchange for the I(1,000<i>c</i>) means of production needed by the
capitalists of Department II. However, a new quantity of money
is required to effect this exchange. It is true that the same
money which has already completed its course, might be
brought into circulation again for this purpose&mdash;in theory, there
could be no objection to this. In practice, however, this solution
is out of the question, for the needs of the capitalists, as consumers,
must be satisfied just as constantly as the needs of the
workers&mdash;they run parallel to the process of production and
must be mediated by specific quantities of money. Hence it
follows that the capitalists of both departments&mdash;that is to say
all capitalists&mdash;must have a further cash reserve in hand, in
addition to the money required as variable capital, in order to
realise their own surplus value in the form of consumer goods.
On the other hand, before the total product is realised and
during the process of its production, certain parts of the constant
capital must be bought continually. These are the circulating
parts of the constant capital, such as raw and auxiliary
materials, semi-finished goods, lighting and the like. Therefore,
not only must the capitalists of Department I have certain
quantities of money in hand to satisfy their needs as consumers,
but the capitalists of Department II must also have money to
meet the requirements of their constant capital. The exchange
of 1,000s I (the surplus value of Department I contained in the
means of production) against goods is thus effected by money
which is advanced partly by the capitalists of Department I in
order to satisfy their needs as consumers, and partly by the
capitalists of Department II in order to satisfy their needs as
producers.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>  Both lots of capitalists may each advance 500 units
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
of the money necessary for the exchange, or possibly the two
departments will contribute in different proportions. At any
rate, two things are certain: (<i>a</i>) the money set aside for the purpose
by both departments must suffice to effect the exchange
between I(1,000<i>s</i>) and II(1,000<i>c</i>); (<i>b</i>) whatever the distribution
of this money between the two departments may have been, the
exchange transaction completed, each department of capitalist
production must again possess the same amount of money it had
earlier put into circulation. This latter maxim applies quite
generally to social circulation as a whole: once the process of
circulation is concluded, money will always have returned to its
point of origin. Thus all capitalists, after universal exchange,
have achieved a twofold result: first they have exchanged products
which, in their natural form, were of no use to them,
against other products which, in their natural form, the capitalists
require either as means of production or for their own
consumption. Secondly, they have regained possession of the
money which they set in circulation so as to effect these acts of
exchange.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is unintelligible from the point of view of
simple commodity circulation, where commodity and money
continually change places&mdash;possession of the commodity excluding
the possession of money, as money constantly usurps the
place which the commodity has given up, and <i>vice versa</i>. Indeed,
this is perfectly true with regard to every individual act of commodity
exchange which is the form of social circulation. Yet
this social circulation itself is more than mere exchange of commodities:
it is the circulation of capital. It is, however, an essential
and characteristic feature of this kind of circulation, that it
does not only return to the capitalist the value of his original
capital plus an increase, the surplus value, but that it also assists
social reproduction by providing the means of production and
labour power in the natural form of productive capital, and by
ensuring the maintenance of those who do not work. Possessing
both the means of production and the money needed, the capitalists
start the total social process of circulation; as soon as the
social capital has completed its circuit, everything is again in
their hands, apportioned to each department according to the
investments made by it. The workers have only temporary
possession of money during which time they convert the variable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
capital from its money form into its natural form. The variable
capital in the capitalists&#8217; hands is nothing but the outward
shape of part of their capital, and for this reason it must always
revert to them.</p>

<p>So far, we have only considered circulation as it takes place
between the two large departments of production. Yet 4,000
units of the first Department&#8217;s produce remain there in the form
of means of production to renew its constant capital of 4,000<i>c</i>.
Moreover 500 of the consumer goods produced in Department
II [corresponding to the surplus value II(500<i>s</i>)] also remain
in this department in the form of consumer goods for the
capitalist class. Since in both departments the mode of production
is capitalistic, that is unplanned, private production, each
department can distribute its own products&mdash;means of production
in Department I and consumer goods in Department II&mdash;amongst
its own capitalists only by way of commodity exchange,
i.e. by a large number of individual sale transactions between
capitalists of the same department. Therefore the capitalists of
both departments must have a reserve of money with which to
perform these exchange transactions&mdash;to renew both the means
of production in Department I and the consumer goods for the
capitalist class in Department II. This part of circulation does
not present any features of specific interest, as it is merely simple
commodity circulation. Vendor and purchaser alike belong to
the same category of agents of production, and circulation is
concerned only with money and commodity changing hands
within the same class and department. All the same, the money
needed for this circulation must from the outset be in the hands
of the capitalist class: it is part of their capital.</p>

<p>So far, the circulation of total social capital presents no
peculiarities, even if we consider the circulation of money. From
the very outset it is self-evident that society must possess a certain
quantity of money to make this circulation possible, and
this for two reasons: first, the general form of capitalist production
is that of commodity production which implies the circulation
of money; secondly, the circulation of capital is based
upon the continuous alternation of the three forms of capital:
money capital, productive capital, and commodity capital.
And as it is this very money, finally, which operates as capital&mdash;our
diagram referring to capitalist production exclusively&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
capitalist class must have possession of this money, as it has
possession of every other form of capital; it throws it into circulation
in order to regain possession as soon as the process of
circulation has been completed.</p>

<p>At first glance, only one detail might strike us: if the capitalists
themselves have set in motion all the money which circulates
in society, they must also advance the money needed for
the realisation of their own surplus value. Thus it seems that the
capitalists as a class ought to buy their own surplus value with
their own money. As the capitalist class has possession of this
money resulting from previous periods of production, even prior
to the realisation of the product of each working period, the
appropriation of surplus value at first sight does not seem to be
based upon the unpaid labour of the wage labourer&mdash;as it in
fact is&mdash;but merely the result of an exchange of commodities
against an equivalent quantity of money both supplied by the
capitalist class itself. A little reflection, however, dispels this
illusion. After the general completion of circulation, the capitalists,
now as before, possess their money funds which either
reverted to them or remained in their hands. Further, they
acquired consumer goods for the same amount which they
have consumed. (Note that we are still confining ourselves to
simple reproduction as the prime condition of our diagram of
reproduction: the renewal of production on the old scale and
the use of all surplus value produced for the personal consumption
of the capitalist class.)</p>

<p>Moreover, the illusion vanishes completely if we do not confine
ourselves to one period of production but observe a number
of successive periods in their mutual interconnections. The
value the capitalist puts into circulation to-day in the form of
money for the purpose of realising his own surplus value, is in
fact nothing but his surplus value resulting from the preceding
period of production in form of money. The capitalist must
advance money out of his own pocket in order to buy his goods
for consumption. On the one hand, the surplus value which he
produces each year either exists in a natural form which renders
it unfit for consumption, or, if it takes a consumable form, it
is temporarily in the hands of another person. On the other
hand, he (the capitalist) has regained possession of the money,
and he is now making his advances by realising his surplus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
value from the preceding period. As soon as he has realised his
new surplus value, which is still embodied in the commodity-form,
this money will return to him. Consequently, in the course
of several periods of production, the capitalist class draws its
consumer goods from the pool, as well as the other natural
forms of its capital. The quantity of money originally in its
possession, however, remains unaffected by this process.</p>

<p>Investigation of the circulation of money in society shows that
the individual capitalist can never invest the whole of his money
capital in production but must always keep a certain money
reserve to be employed as variable capital, i.e. as wages.
Further, he must keep a capital reserve for the purchase of
means of production at any given period, and in addition, he
must have a cash reserve for his personal consumption.</p>

<p>The process of reproducing the total social capital thus
entails the necessity of producing and reproducing the substance
of money. Money is also capital, for Marx&#8217;s diagram
which we have discussed before, conceives of no other than
capitalist production. Thus the diagram seems incomplete. We
ought to add a further department, that of production of the
means of exchange, to the other two large departments of social
production [those of means of production (I) and of consumer
goods (II)]. It is, indeed, a characteristic feature of this third
department that it serves neither the purposes of production
nor those of consumption, merely representing social labour in
an undifferentiated commodity that cannot be used. Though
money and its production, like the exchange and production
of commodities, are much older than the capitalist mode of production,
it was only the latter which made the circulation of
money a general form of social circulation, and thus the essential
element of the social reproductive process. We can only
obtain a comprehensive diagram of the essential points of capitalist
production if we demonstrate the original relationship
between the production and reproduction of money and the
two other departments of social production.</p>

<p>Here, however, we deviate from Marx. He included the production
of gold (we have reduced the total production of money
to the production of gold for the sake of simplicity) in the first
department of social production.</p>

<p>&#8216;The production of gold, like that of metals generally, belongs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
to department I, which occupies itself with means of production.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>This is correct only in so far as the production of gold is the
production of metal for industrial purposes (jewellery, dental
stoppings, etc.). But gold in its capacity as money is not a metal
but rather an embodiment of social labour <i>in abstracto</i>. Thus it
is no more a means of production than it is a consumer good.
Besides, a mere glance at the diagram of reproduction itself
shows what inconsistencies must result from confusing means of
exchange with means of production. If we add a diagrammatic
representation of the annual production of gold as the substance
of money to the two departments of social production, we get
the following three sets of figures:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="6">
<tr><td align="right">I.</td><td align="right">4,000<i>c</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,000<i>v</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,000<i>s</i></td><td align="right">=</td><td align="right">6,000</td><td align="left">means of production</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">II.</td><td align="right">2,000<i>c</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">500<i>v</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">500<i>s</i></td><td align="right">=</td><td align="right">3,000</td><td align="left">means of subsistence</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">III.</td><td align="right">20<i>c</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">5<i>v</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">5<i>s</i></td><td align="right">=</td><td align="right">30</td><td align="left">means of exchange</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This quantity of value of 30, chosen by Marx as an example,
obviously does not represent the quantity of money which circulates
annually in society; it only stands for that part which is
annually reproduced, the annual wear and tear of the money
substance which, on the average, remains constant so long as
social reproduction remains on the same level. The turnover of
capital goes on in a regular manner and the realisation of commodities
proceeds at an equal pace. If we consider the third line
as an integral part of the first one, as Marx wants us to do, the
following difficulty arises: the constant capital of the third
department consists of real and concrete means of production,
premises, tools, auxiliary materials, vessels, and the like, just as
it does in the two other departments. Its product, however, the
30<i>g</i> which represent money, cannot operate in its natural form
as constant capital in any process of production. If we therefore
include this 30<i>g</i> as an essential part of the product of Department
I (6,000 means of production) the means of production
will show a social deficit of this size which will prevent Departments
I and II from resuming their reproduction on the old
scale. According to the previous assumption&mdash;which forms the
foundation of Marx&#8217;s whole diagram&mdash;reproduction as a whole
starts from the product of each department in its actual use-form.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
The proportions of the diagram are based upon this
assumption; without it, they dissolve in chaos. Thus the first
fundamental relation of value is based upon the equation:
I(6,000) equals I(4,000<i>c</i>)&nbsp;+ II(2,000<i>c</i>). This cannot apply to the
product III(30<i>g</i>), since neither department can use gold as a
means of production [say, in the proportion of I(20<i>c</i>)&nbsp;+ II(10<i>c</i>)].
The second fundamental relation derived from this is based
upon the equation I(1,000<i>v</i>)&nbsp;+ I(1,000<i>s</i>)&nbsp;= II(2,000<i>c</i>). This would
mean, with regard to the production of gold, that as many consumer
goods are taken from Department II as there are means
of production supplied to it. But this is equally untrue. Though
the production of gold removes concrete means of production
from the total social product and uses them as its constant
capital, though it takes concrete consumer goods for the use of
its workers and capitalists, corresponding to its variable capital
and surplus value, the product it supplies yet cannot operate in
any branch of production as a means of production, nor is it a
consumer good, fit for human consumption. To include the
production of money in the activities of Department I, therefore,
is to run counter to all the general proportions which
express the relations of value in Marx&#8217;s diagram, and to
diminish the diagram&#8217;s validity.</p>

<p>The attempt by Marx to find room for the production of gold
within Department I (means of production) moreover leads to
dubious results. The first act of circulation between this new
sub-Department (called by Marx I<i>g</i>) and Department II (consumer
goods) consists as usual in the workers&#8217; purchase of consumer
goods from Department II with the money obtained as
wages from the capitalists. This money is not yet a product of
the new period of production. It has been reserved by the
capitalists of Department I<i>g</i> out of the money contained in
their product of an earlier period. This, indeed, is the normal
procedure. But now Marx allows the capitalists of Department
II to buy gold from I<i>g</i> with the money they have reserved,
gold as a commodity material to the value of 2. This is
a leap from the production of money into the industrial production
of gold which is no more to do with the problem of the
production of money than with the production of boot-polish.
Yet out of the 5 I<i>g v</i> that have been reserved, 3 still remain, and
as the capitalist, unable to use them as constant capital, does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
know what to do with them, Marx arranges for him to add
them on to his own reserve of money. Marx further finds the
following way out to avoid a deficit in the constant capital of
II which must be exchanged completely against the means of
production (I<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ I<i>s</i>):</p>

<p>&#8216;Therefore, this money must be entirely transferred from II<i>c</i>
to II<i>s</i>, no matter whether it exists in necessities of life or articles
of luxury, and vice versa, a corresponding value of commodities
must be transferred from II<i>s</i> to II<i>c</i>. Result: A portion of the
surplus-value is accumulated as a hoard of money.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>A strange result, in all conscience! We have achieved an increase
in money, a surplus of the money substance, by simply
confining ourselves to the annual wear and tear of the money
fund. This surplus value comes into existence, for some unknown
reason, at the expense of the capitalists in the consumer
goods department. They practise abstinence, not because they
may want to expand their production of surplus value, let us
say, but in order to secure a sufficient quantity of consumer
goods for the workers engaged in the production of gold.</p>

<p>The capitalists of Department II, however, get poor reward
for this Christian virtue. In spite of their abstinence, they are
not only unable to expand their reproduction, but they are no
longer even in the position to resume their production on its
former scale. Even if the corresponding &#8216;commodity value&#8217; is
transferred from II<i>g</i> to II<i>c</i>, it is not only the value but its
actual and concrete form which matters. As the new part of the
product of I now consists of money which cannot be used as a
means of production, Department II, in spite of its abstinence,
cannot renew its constant material capital on the old scale. As
our diagram presupposes simple reproduction, its condition are
thus violated in two directions: surplus value is being hoarded,
and the constant capital shows a deficit. Marx&#8217;s own results,
then, prove that the production of gold cannot possibly find a
place in either of the two departments of his diagram; the whole
diagram is upset as soon as the first act of exchange between
Departments I and II has been completed. As Engels remarks
in his footnote, &#8216;the analysis of the exchange of newly produced
gold within the constant capital of Department I is not contained
in the MS.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>  Besides, the inconsistency would then only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
have been greater. The point of view we advocate is confirmed
by Marx himself when he gives an exhaustive answer to the
question, as striking as it is brief: &#8216;Money in itself is not an
element of actual reproduction.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>There is another important reason why we should put the
production of money in a third and separate department of
social production as a whole: Marx&#8217;s diagram of simple reproduction
is valid as the starting-point and foundation of the
reproductive process not only for capitalism but also, <i>mutatis
mutandis</i>, for every regulated and planned economic order, for
instance a socialist one. However, the production of money,
just like the commodity-form of the products, becomes obsolete
when private ownership of the means of production is abolished.
It constitutes the &#8216;illegitimate&#8217; liabilities, the <i>faux frais</i> of the
anarchic economy under capitalism, a peculiar burden for a
society based upon private enterprise, which implies the annual
expenditure of a considerable amount of labour on the manufacture
of products which are neither means of production nor
yet consumer goods. This peculiar expenditure of labour by a
society producing under capitalism will vanish in a socially
planned economy. It is most adequately demonstrated by
means of a separate department within the process of reproducing
social capital. It is quite immaterial in this connection
whether we picture a country which produces its own gold or a
country which imports gold from abroad. The same expenditure
of social labour which in the first case is necessary for the
direct production of gold, is required in the second case to effect
the exchange transactions.</p>

<p>These observations show that the problem of the reproduction
of total capital is not so crude as it often appears to those
who approach it merely from the point of view of crises. The
central problem might be formulated as follows: how is it
possible that, in an unplanned economy, the aggregate production
of innumerable individual capitalists can satisfy all the
needs of society? One answer that suggests itself points to the
continual fluctuations in the level of production in accordance
with the fluctuating demand, i.e. the periodical changes in the
market. This point of view, which regards the aggregate product
of society as an undifferentiated mass of commodities, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
treats social demand in an equally absurd way, overlooks the
most important element, the <i>differentia specifica</i> of the capitalist
mode of production. We have seen that the problem of capitalist
reproduction contains quite a number of precisely defined relations
referring to specific capitalist categories and also, <i>mutatis
mutandis</i>, to the general categories of human labour. The real
problem consists in their inherent tendencies towards both conflict
and harmony. Marx&#8217;s diagram is the scientific formulation
of the problem.</p>

<p>Inquiry must now be made into the implications of this
diagram analytic of the process of production. Has it any real
bearing on the problems of actual life? According to the
diagram, circulation absorbs the entire social product; all consumers&#8217;
needs are satisfied, and reproduction takes place without
friction. The circulation of money succeeds the circulation
of commodities, completing the cycle of social capital. But what
is the position in real life? The relations outlined in the diagram
lay down a precise first principle for the division of social labour
in a planned production&mdash;always providing a system of simple
reproduction, i.e. no changes in the volume of production. But
no such planned organisation of the total process exists in a
capitalist economy, and things do not run smoothly, along a
mathematical formula, as suggested by the diagram. On the
contrary, the course of reproduction shows continual deviations
from the proportions of the diagram which become manifest
(<i>a</i>) in the fluctuations of prices from day to day; (<i>b</i>) in the continual
fluctuations of profits; (<i>c</i>) in the ceaseless flow of capital
from one branch of production to another, and finally in the
periodical and cyclical swings of reproduction between over-production
and crisis.</p>

<p>And yet, apart from all these deviations, the diagram presents
a socially necessary average level in which all these movements
must centre, to which they are always striving to return,
once they have left it. That is why the fluctuating movements
of the individual capitalists do not degenerate into chaos but
are reduced to a certain order which ensures the prolonged
existence of society in spite of its lack of a plan.</p>

<p>In comparison, the similarities and the profound discrepancies
between Marx&#8217;s diagram of reproduction and Quesnay&#8217;s
<i>Tableau Économique</i> strike us at once. These two diagrams, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
beginning and end of the period of classical economics, are the
only attempts to describe an apparent chaos in precise terms, a
chaos created by the interrelated movements of capitalist production
and consumption, and by the disparity of innumerable
private producers and consumers. Both writers reduce this
chaotic jumble of individual capitals to a few broadly conceived
rules which serve, as it were, as moorings for the development
of capitalist society, in spite of its chaos. They both achieve a
synthesis between the two aspects which are the basis of the
whole movement of social capital: that circulation is at one and
the same time a capitalist process of producing and appropriating
surplus value, and also a social process of producing
and consuming material goods necessary to civilised human
existence. Both show the circulation of commodities to act as a
mediator for the social process as a whole, and both conceive
of the circulation of money as a subsidiary phenomenon, an
external and superficial expression of the various stages within
the circulation of commodities.</p>

<p>It is socially necessary labour which creates value. This
inspired fundamental law of Marx&#8217;s theory of value which
provided the solution of the money problem, amongst others,
further led him first to distinguish and then to integrate those
two aspects in the total reproductive process: the aspect of
value and that of actual material connections. Secondly, Marx&#8217;s
diagram is based upon the precise distinction between constant
and variable capital which alone reveals the internal
mechanisms of the production of surplus value and brings it, as
a value-relationship, into precise relation with the two material
categories of production: that of producer and consumer goods.</p>

<p>After Quesnay, some classical economists, Adam Smith and
Ricardo in particular, came fairly close to this point of view.
Ricardo&#8217;s contribution, his precise elaboration of the theory of
value, has even been frequently confused with that of Marx. On
the basis of his own theory of value, Ricardo saw that Smith&#8217;s
method of resolving the price of all commodities into <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>&mdash;a
theory which wrought so much havoc in the analysis of reproduction&mdash;is
wrong; but he was not much interested in Smith&#8217;s
mistake, nor indeed very enthusiastic about the problem of reproduction
as a whole. His analysis, in fact, represents a certain
decline after that of Adam Smith, just as Smith had partly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
retrogressed as against the Physiocrats. If Ricardo expounded
the fundamental value categories of bourgeois economy&mdash;wages,
surplus value and capital&mdash;much more precisely and consistently
than his predecessors, he also treated them more
rigidly. Adam Smith had shown infinitely more understanding
for the living connections, the broad movements of the whole.
In consequence he did not mind giving two, or, as in the case of
the problem of value, even three or four different answers to the
same question. Though he contradicts himself quite cheerfully
in the various parts of his analysis, these very contradictions are
ever stimulating him to renewed effort, they make him approach
the problem as a whole from an ever different point of view,
and so to grasp its dynamics. Ultimately, it was the limitation
of their bourgeois mentalities which doomed both Smith and
Ricardo to failure. A proper understanding of the fundamental
categories of capitalist production, of value and surplus value as
living dynamics of the social process demands the understanding
of this process in its historical development and of the categories
themselves as historically conditioned forms of the general
relations of labour. This means that only a socialist can really
solve the problem of the reproduction of capital. Between the
<i>Tableau Économique</i> and the diagram of reproduction in the
second volume of <i>Capital</i> there lies the prosperity and decline of
bourgeois economics, both in time and in substance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>CHAPTER VI</i></h2>

<h2>ENLARGED REPRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The shortcomings of the diagram of simple reproduction
are obvious: it explains the laws of a form of reproduction
which is possible only as an occasional exception in
a capitalist economy. It is not simple but enlarged reproduction
which is the rule in every capitalist economic system, even
more so than in any other.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, this diagram is of real scientific importance in
two respects. In practice, even under conditions of enlarged
reproduction, the greater part of the social product can be
looked on as simple reproduction, which forms the broad basis
upon which production in every case expands beyond its former
limits. In theory, the analysis of simple reproduction also provides
the necessary starting point for all scientific exposition of
enlarged reproduction. The diagram of simple reproduction
of the aggregate social capital therefore inevitably introduces
the further problem of the enlarged reproduction of the total
capital.</p>

<p>We already know the historical peculiarity of enlarged reproduction
on a capitalist basis. It must represent itself as
accumulation of capital, which is both its specific form and its
specific condition. That is to say, social production as a whole&mdash;which
on a capitalist basis is the production of surplus value&mdash;can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
in every case be expanded only in so far as the social
capital that has been previously active is now augmented by
surplus value of its own creation. This use of part of the surplus
value (and in particular the use of an increasing part of it) for
the purpose of production instead of personal consumption by
the capitalist class, or else the increase of reserves, is the basis of
enlarged reproduction under capitalist conditions of production.</p>

<p>The characteristic feature of enlarged reproduction of the
aggregate social capital&mdash;just as in our previous assumption of
simple reproduction&mdash;is the reproduction of individual capitals,
since production as a whole, whether regarded as simple or as
enlarged production, can in fact only occur in the form of
innumerable independent movements of reproduction performed
by private individual capitals.</p>

<p>The first comprehensive analysis of the accumulation of individual
capitals is given in volume i of Marx&#8217;s <i>Capital</i>, section 7,
chapters 22, 23. Here Marx treats of (<i>a</i>) the division of the
surplus value into capital and revenue; (<i>b</i>) the circumstances
which determine the accumulation of capital apart from this
division, such as the degree of exploitation of labour power and
labour productivity; (<i>c</i>) the growth of fixed capital relative to
the circulating capital as a factor of accumulation; and (<i>d</i>) the
increasing development of an industrial reserve army which is
at the same time both a consequence and a prerequisite of the
process of accumulation. In the course of this discussion, Marx
deals with two inspired notions of bourgeois economists with
regard to accumulation: the &#8216;theory of abstinence&#8217; as held by
the more vulgar economists, who proclaim that the division of
surplus value into capital, and thus accumulation itself, is an
ethical and heroic act of the capitalists; and the fallacy of the
classical economists, their doctrine that the entire capitalised
part of the surplus value is used solely for consumption by the
productive workers, that is to say spent altogether on wages for
the workers employed year by year. This erroneous assumption,
which completely overlooks the fact that every increase of production
must manifest itself not only in the increased number of
employed workers but also in the increase of the material means
of production (premises, tools, and, certainly, raw materials) is
obviously rooted in that &#8216;dogma&#8217; of Adam Smith which we
have already discussed. Moreover, the assumption that the expenditure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
of a greater amount of capital on wages is sufficient
to expand production, also results from the mistaken idea that
the prices of all commodities are completely resolved into wages
and surplus value, so that the constant capital is disregarded
altogether. Strangely enough, even Ricardo who was, at any
rate occasionally, aware of this element of error in Smith&#8217;s
doctrine, subscribes most emphatically to its ultimate inferences,
mistaken though they were:</p>

<p>&#8216;It must be understood, that all the productions of a country
are consumed; but it makes the greatest difference imaginable
whether they are consumed by those who reproduce, or by those
who do not reproduce another value. When we say that revenue
is saved, and added to capital, what we mean is, that the portion
of revenue, so said to be added to capital, is consumed
by productive, instead of unproductive labourers.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>If all the goods produced are thus swallowed up by human
consumption, there can clearly be no room to spare in the total
social product for such unconsumable means of production as
tools and machinery, new materials and buildings, and consequently
enlarged reproduction, too, will have to take a peculiar
course. What happens&mdash;according to this odd conception&mdash;is
simply that staple foodstuffs for new workers will be produced
to the amount of the capitalised part of surplus value instead of
the choice delicacies previously provided for the capitalist class.
The classical theory of enlarged reproduction does not admit
of any variations other than those connected with the production
of consumer goods. After our previous observations it is not
surprising that Marx could easily dispose of this elementary
mistake of both Ricardo and Smith. Just as simple reproduction
requires a regulated renewal of the constant capital, the material
means of production, quite apart from the production of consumer
goods in the necessary quantity for labourer and capitalist,
equally so in the case of expanding production must
part of the new additional capital be used to enlarge the constant
capital, that is to add to the material means of production.
Another law, Marx discovered, must also be applied here. The
constant capital, continually overlooked by the classical economists,
increases relative to the variable capital that is spent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
on wages. This is merely the capitalist expression of the general
effects of increasing labour productivity. With technical progress,
human labour is able to set in motion ever larger masses
of means of production and to convert them into goods. In
capitalist terms, this means a progressive decrease in expenses
for living labour, in wages, relative to the expenses for inanimate
means of production. Contrary to the assumption of Adam
Smith and Ricardo, enlarged reproduction must not only start
with the division of the capitalised part of the surplus value into
constant and variable capital, but, as the technique of production
advances, it is bound to allocate in this division ever
increasing portions to the constant, and ever diminishing portions
to the variable capital. This continuous qualitative change
in the composition of capital is the specific manifestation of the
accumulation of capital, that is to say of enlarged reproduction
on the basis of capitalism.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
The other side of this picture of continual changes in the
relation between the portions of constant and variable capital
is the formation of a relative surplus population, as Marx called
it, that is to say that part of the working population which
exceeds the average needs of capital, and thus becomes redundant.
This reserve of unemployable industrial labour (taken
here in a broader sense, and including a proletariat that is
dominated by merchant capital) is always present. It forms a
necessary prerequisite of the sudden expansion of production
in times of boom, and is another specific condition of capitalist
accumulation.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>From the accumulation of individual capitals we can therefore
deduce the following four characteristic phenomena of
enlarged reproduction:</p>

<p>(1) The volume of enlarged reproduction is independent,
within certain limits, of the growth of capital, and can transcend
it. The necessary methods for achieving this are: increased exploitation
of labour and natural forces, and increased labour
productivity (including increased efficiency of the fixed capital).</p>

<p>(2) All real accumulation starts with that part of the surplus
value which is intended for capitalisation being divided into
constant and variable capital.</p>

<p>(3) Accumulation as a social process is accompanied by continuous
changes in the relation between constant and variable
capital, whereby that portion of capital which is invested in
inanimate means of production continually increases as compared
with that expended on wages.</p>

<p>(4) Concomitant with the accumulative process, and as a
condition of the latter, there develops an industrial reserve
army.</p>

<p>These characteristics, derived from the reproductive process
as it is performed by the individual capitals, represent an enormous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
step forward as compared with the analyses of bourgeois
economists. Now, however, our problem is to demonstrate the
accumulation of the aggregate capital which originates from
these movements of individual capitals, and on the basis of the
diagram of simple reproduction to establish the precise relations
between the aspects of value prevalent in the production of
surplus value and the material considerations in the production
of consumer and producer goods, with a view to accumulation.</p>

<p>The essential difference between enlarged reproduction and
simple reproduction consists in the fact that in the latter the
capitalist class and its hangers-on consume the entire surplus
value, whereas in the former a part of the surplus value is set
aside from the personal consumption of its owners, not for the
purpose of hoarding, but in order to increase the active capital,
i.e. for capitalisation. To make this possible, the new additional
capital must also find the material prerequisites for its activity
forthcoming. Here the concrete composition of the aggregate
social product becomes important. Marx says already in
volume i, when he considers the accumulation of individual
capitals:</p>

<p>&#8216;The annual production must in the first place furnish all
those objects (use-values) from which the material components
of capital, used up in the course of the year, have to be replaced.
Deducting these there remains the net or surplus-product, in
which the surplus-value lies. And of what does this surplus-product
consist? Only of things destined to satisfy the wants and
desires of the capitalist class, things which, consequently, enter
into the consumption fund of the capitalists? Were that the case,
the cup of surplus-value would be drained to the very dregs,
and nothing but simple reproduction would ever take place.&mdash;To
accumulate it is necessary to convert a portion of the surplus-product
into capital. But we cannot, except by a miracle, convert
into capital anything but such articles as can be employed
in the labour-process (i.e. means of production), and such
further articles as are suitable for the sustenance of the labourer,
(i.e. means of subsistence). Consequently, a part of the annual
surplus-labour must have been applied to the production of
additional means of production and subsistence, over and above
the quantity of these things required to replace the capital
advanced. In one word, surplus-value is convertible into capital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
solely because the surplus-product, whose value it is, already
comprises the material elements of new capital.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Additional means of production, however, and additional
consumer goods for the workers alone are not sufficient; to get
enlarged reproduction really going, additional labour is also required.
Marx now finds a specific difficulty in this last condition:</p>

<p>&#8216;For this the mechanism of capitalist production provides
beforehand, by converting the working class into a class dependent
on wages, a class whose ordinary wages suffice, not only for
its maintenance, but for its increase. It is only necessary for
capital to incorporate this additional labour-power, annually
supplied by the working class in the shape of labourers of all
ages, with the surplus means of production comprised in the
annual produce, and the conversion of surplus-value into capital
is complete.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>This is the first solution which Marx gave to the problem of
the accumulation of the aggregate capital. Having dwelt on
this aspect of the question already in volume i of <i>Capital</i>, Marx
returns to the problem at the end of the second volume of his
main work whose concluding 21st chapter is devoted to accumulation
and enlarged reproduction of the aggregate capital.</p>

<p>Let us examine Marx&#8217;s diagrammatic exposition of accumulation
more closely. On the model of the diagram of simple reproduction
with which we are already familiar, he devised a
diagram for enlarged reproduction, the difference appearing
most clearly if we compare the two.</p>

<p>Assuming that society&#8217;s annual aggregate product can be
represented by an amount to the value of 9,000 (denoting
millions of working hours, or, in capitalist monetary terms, any
arbitrary amount of money), the aggregate product is to be
distributed as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="7">
<tr><td align="right">I.</td><td align="right">4,000<i>c</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,000<i>v</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,000<i>s</i></td><td align="right">=</td><td align="right">6,000</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">II.</td><td align="right">2,000<i>c</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">500<i>v</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">500<i>s</i></td><td align="right">=</td><td align="right">3,000</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="7" align="right">Total:</td><td align="right" class="topb">9,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Department I represents means of production, Department II
consumer goods. One glance at the proportion of the figures
shows that in this case simple reproduction alone is possible.
The means of production made in Department I equal the total
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
of the means of production actually used by the two departments.
If these are merely renewed, production can be repeated
only on its previous scale. On the other hand, the aggregate
product of Department II equals the total of wages and surplus
value in both departments. This shows that the consumer goods
available permit only the employment of just as many workers
as were previously employed, and that the entire surplus value
is similarly spent on consumer goods, i.e. the personal consumption
of the capitalist class.</p>

<p>Now let us take the same aggregate product of 9,000 in the
following equation:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="8">
<tr><td align="right">I.</td><td align="right">4,000<i>c</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,000<i>v</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,000<i>s</i></td><td align="right">=</td><td align="right">6,000</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">II.</td><td align="right">1,500<i>c</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">750<i>v</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">750<i>s</i></td><td align="right">=</td><td align="right">3,000</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right" colspan="7">Total:</td><td class="topb" align="right">9,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Here a double disproportion confronts us: 6,000 means of
production are created&mdash;more than those which are actually
used by the society, i.e. 4,000<i>c</i>&nbsp;+ 1,500<i>c</i>, leaving a surplus of 500.
Similarly, less consumer goods (3,000) are produced than the
sum of what is paid out in wages (i.e. 1,000<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ 750<i>v</i>, the requirement
of the workers), plus the aggregate of surplus value that
has been produced (1,000<i>s</i>&nbsp;+ 750<i>s</i>). This results in a deficit of
500. Since our premises do not allow us to decrease the number
of workers employed, the consequence must be that the capitalist
class cannot consume the entire surplus value it has
pocketed. This proves fully consistent with the two material preconditions
of enlarged reproduction on a capitalist basis: part of
the appropriated surplus value is not to be consumed but is
used for the purposes of production; and more means of production
must be produced so as to ensure the use of the capitalised
surplus value for the actual expansion of reproduction.</p>

<p>In considering the diagram of simple reproduction, we saw
that its fundamental social conditions are contained in the following
equation: the aggregate of means of production (the
product of Department I) must be equivalent to the constant
capital of both departments, but the aggregate of consumer
goods (the product of Department II) must equal the sum of
variable capitals <i>and</i> surplus values of the two departments. As
regards enlarged reproduction, we must now infer a precise
inverse double ratio. The general precondition of enlarged reproduction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
is that the product of Department I must be greater
in value than the constant capital of both departments taken
together, and that of Department II must be so much less than
the sum total of both the variable capital and the surplus value
in the two departments.</p>

<p>This, however, by no means completes the analysis of enlarged
reproduction; rather has it led us merely to the threshold of the
question. Having deduced the proportions of the diagram, we
must now pursue their further activities, the flow of circulation
and the continuity of reproduction. Just as simple reproduction
may be compared to an unchanging circle, to be repeated time
and again, so enlarged reproduction, to quote Sismondi, is comparable
to a spiral with ever expanding loops. Let us begin by
examining the loops of this spiral. The first general question
arising in this connection is how actual accumulation proceeds
in the two departments under the conditions now known to us,
i.e. how the capitalists may capitalise part of their surplus value,
and at the same time acquire the material prerequisites necessary
for enlarged reproduction.</p>

<p>Marx expounds the question in the following way:</p>

<p>Let us assume that half the surplus value of Department I is
being accumulated. The capitalists, then, use 500 for their consumption
but augment their capital by another 500. In order to
become active, this additional capital of 500 must be divided, as
we now know, into constant and variable capital. Assuming the
ratio of 4 to 1 remains what it was for the original capital, the
capitalists of Department I will divide their additional capital
of 500 thus: they will buy new means of production for 400 and
new labour for 100. This does not present any difficulties, since
we know that Department I has already produced a surplus of
500 means of production. Yet the corresponding enlargement of
the variable capital by 100 units of money is not enough, since
the new additional labour power must also find adequate consumer
goods which can only be supplied by Department II.
Now the circulation between the two large departments is shifting.
Formerly, under conditions of simple reproduction, Department
I acquired 1,000 consumer goods for its own workers, and
now it must find another 100 for its new workers. Department I
therefore engages in enlarged reproduction as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="9">
<tr><td align="center">4,400<i>c</i></td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">1,100<i>v</i>.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Department II, in turn, after selling these consumer goods to
the value of 100, is now in a position to acquire additional
means of production to the same amount from Department I.
And in fact, Department I still has precisely one hundred of its
surplus product left over which now find their way into Department
II, enabling the latter to expand its own reproduction as
well. Yet here, too, the additional means of production alone
are not much use; to make them operate, additional labour
power is needed. Assuming again that the previous composition
of capital has been maintained, with a ratio of 2 to 1 as regards
constant and variable capital, additional labour to the tune of
50 is required to work the additional 100 means of production.
This additional labour, however, needs additional consumer
goods to the amount of its wages, which are in fact supplied by
Department II itself. This department must therefore produce,
in addition to the 100 additional consumer goods for the new
workers of Department I and the goods for the consumption of
its own workers, a further amount of consumer goods to the tune
of 50 as part of its aggregate product. Department II therefore
starts on enlarged reproduction at a rate of 1,600<i>c</i>&nbsp;+ 800<i>v</i>.</p>

<p>Now the aggregate product of Department I (6,000) has been
absorbed completely. 5,500 were necessary for renewing the old
and used-up means of production in both departments, and the
remaining 500 for the expansion of production: 400 in Department
I and 100 in Department II. As regards the aggregate
product of Department II (3,000), 1,900 have been used for the
increased labour force in the two departments, and the 1,100
consumer goods which remain serve the capitalists for their personal
consumption, the consumption of their surplus value. 500
are consumed in Department I, and 600 in Department II
where, out of a surplus value of 700, only 150 had been capitalised
(100 being expended on means of production and 50 on
wages).</p>

<p>Enlarged reproduction can now proceed on its course. If we
maintain our rate of exploitation at 100 per cent, as in the case
of the original capital, the next period will give the following
results:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="10">
<tr><td align="right">I.</td><td align="right">4,400<i>c</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,100<i>v</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,100<i>s</i></td><td align="right">=</td><td align="right">6,600</td></tr>

<tr><td align="right" colspan="7">Total:</td><td align="right" class="topb">9,800</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
The aggregate product of society has grown from 9,000 to
9,800, the surplus value of Department I from 1,000 to 1,100,
and of Department II from 750 to 800. The object of the
capitalist expansion of production, the increased production of
surplus value, has been gained. At the same time, the material
composition of the aggregate social product again shows a surplus
of 600 as regards the means of production (6,600) over and
above those which are actually needed (4,400&nbsp;+ 1,600), and also
a deficit in consumer goods as against the sum total made up by
the wages previously paid (1,100<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ 800<i>v</i>) and the surplus value
that has been created (1,100<i>s</i>&nbsp;+ 800<i>s</i>). And thus we again have
the material possibility as well as the necessity to use part of the
surplus value, not for consumption by the capitalist class, but
for a new expansion of production.</p>

<p>The second enlargement of production, and increased production
of surplus value, thus follows from the first as a matter
of course and with mathematical precision. The accumulation
of capital, once it has started, automatically leads farther and
farther beyond itself. The circle has become a spiral which
winds itself higher and higher as if compelled by a natural law
in the guise of mathematical terms. Assuming that in the following
years there is always capitalisation of half the surplus
value, while the composition of the capital and the rate of
exploitation remain unchanged, the reproduction of capital
will result in the following progression:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Thus, after five years of accumulation, the aggregate social
product is found to have grown from 9,000 to 14,348, the social
aggregate capital from (5,500<i>c</i>&nbsp;+ 1,750<i>v</i>&nbsp;= 7,250) to (8,784<i>c</i>&nbsp;+
2,782<i>v</i>&nbsp;= 11,566) and the surplus value from (1,000<i>s</i>&nbsp;+ 500<i>s</i>&nbsp;= 1,500)
to (1,464<i>s</i>&nbsp;+ 1,065<i>s</i>&nbsp;= 2,529), whereby the surplus value for personal
consumption, being 1,500 at the beginning of accumulation,
has grown to 732&nbsp;+ 958&nbsp;= 1,690 in the last year.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>  The
capitalist class, then, has capitalised more, it has practised
greater abstinence, and yet it has been able to live better.
Society, in a material respect, has become richer, richer in
means of production, richer in consumer goods, and it has
equally become richer in the capitalist sense of the term since it
produces more surplus value. The social product circulates <i>in
toto</i> in society. Partly it serves to enlarge reproduction and
partly it serves consumption. The requirements of capitalist
accumulation correspond to the material composition of the
aggregate social product. What Marx said in volume i of
<i>Capital</i> is true: the increased surplus value can be added on to
capital because the social surplus product comes into the world
from the very first in the material form of means of production,
in a form incapable of utilisation except in the productive process.
At the same time reproduction expands in strict conformity
with the laws of circulation: the mutual supply of the
two departments of production with additional means of production
and consumer goods proceeds as an exchange of equivalents.
It is an exchange of commodities in the course of which
the very accumulation of one department is the condition of
accumulation in the other and makes this possible. The complicated
problem of accumulation is thus converted into a
diagrammatic progression of surprising simplicity. We may
continue the above chain of equations <i>ad infinitum</i> so long as we
observe this simple principle: that a certain increase in the constant
capital of Department I always necessitates a certain
increase in its variable capital, which predetermines beforehand
the extent of the increase in Department II, with which again
a corresponding increase in the variable capital must be co-ordinated.
Finally, it depends on the extent of increase in the
variable capital in both departments, how much of the total
may remain for personal consumption by the capitalist class.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
The extent of this increase will also show that this amount of
consumer goods which remains for private consumption by the
capitalist is exactly equivalent to that part of the surplus value
which has not been capitalised in either department.</p>

<p>There are no limits to the continuation of this diagrammatic
development of accumulation in accordance with the few easy
rules we have demonstrated. But now it is time to take care lest
we should only have achieved these surprisingly smooth results
through simply working out certain fool-proof mathematical
exercises in addition and subtraction, and we must further
inquire whether it is not merely because mathematical equations
are easily put on paper that accumulation will continue
<i>ad infinitum</i> without any friction.</p>

<p>In other words: the time has come to look for the concrete
social conditions of accumulation.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER VII</i></h2>

<h2>ANALYSIS OF MARX&#8217;S DIAGRAM
OF ENLARGED REPRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The first enlargement of reproduction gave the following picture:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="12">
<tr><td align="right">I.</td><td align="right">4,400<i>c</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,100<i>v</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,100<i>s</i></td><td align="right">=</td><td align="right">6,600</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>This already clearly expresses the interdependence of the
two departments&mdash;but it is a dependence of a peculiar kind.
Accumulation here originates in Department I, and Department
II merely follows suit. Thus it is Department I alone that
determines the volume of accumulation. Marx effects accumulation
here by allowing Department I to capitalise one-half of its
surplus value; Department II, however, may capitalise only as
much as is necessary to assure the production and accumulation
of Department I. He makes the capitalists of Department II
consume 600<i>s</i> as against the consumption of only 500<i>s</i> by the
capitalists of Department I who have appropriated twice the
amount of value and far more surplus value. In the next year,
he assumes the capitalists of Department I again to capitalise
half their surplus value, this time making the capitalists of
Department II capitalise more than in the previous year&mdash;summarily
fixing the amount to tally exactly with the needs of
Department I. 500<i>s</i> now remain for the consumption of the
capitalists of Department II&mdash;less than the year before&mdash;surely
a rather queer result of accumulation on any showing. Marx
now describes the process as follows:</p>

<p>&#8216;Then let Department I continue accumulation at the same
ratio, so that 550<i>s</i> are spent as revenue, and 55<i>s</i> accumulated.
In that case, 1,100 I<i>v</i> are first replaced by 1,100 I<i>c</i>, and 550 I<i>s</i>
must be realised in an equal amount of commodities of II,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
making a total of 1,650 I(<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>). But the constant capital of II,
which is to be replaced, amounts only to 1,600, and the remaining
50 must be made up out of 800 II<i>s</i>. Leaving aside the money
aspect of the matter, we have as a result of this transaction:</p>

<p>&#8216;I. 4,400<i>c</i>&nbsp;+ 550<i>s</i> (to be capitalised); furthermore, realised in
commodities of II for the fund for consumption of the capitalists
and labourers of I, 1,650 (<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>).</p>

<p>&#8216;II. 1,650<i>c</i> + 825<i>v</i> + 725<i>s</i>.</p>

<p>&#8216;In Department I, 550<i>s</i> must be capitalised. If the former proportion
is maintained, 440 of this amount form constant capital,
and 110 variable capital. These 110 must be eventually taken
out of 725 II<i>s</i>, that is to say, articles of consumption to the value
of 110 are consumed by the labourers of I instead of the
capitalists of II, so that the latter are compelled to capitalise
these 110<i>s</i> which they cannot consume. This leaves 615 II<i>s</i> of
the 725 II<i>s</i>. But if II thus converts these 110 into additional
constant capital, it requires an additional variable capital of 55.
This again must be taken out of its surplus value. Subtracting
this amount from 615 II<i>s</i>, we find that only 560 II<i>s</i> remain for
the consumption of the capitalists of II, and we obtain the
following values of capital after accomplishing all actual and
potential transfers:</p>

<p>This quotation is given at length since it shows very clearly
how Marx here effects accumulation in Department I at the
expense of Department II. In the years that follow, the capitalists
of the provisions department get just as rough a deal.
Following the same rules, Marx allows them in the third year to
accumulate 264<i>s</i>&mdash;a larger amount this time than in the two
preceding years. In the fourth year they are allowed to capitalise
290<i>s</i> and to consume 678<i>s</i>, and in the fifth year they accumulate
320<i>s</i> and consume 745<i>s</i>. Marx even says: &#8216;If things are to proceed
normally, accumulation in II must take place more rapidly
than in I, because that portion of I(<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>) which must be converted
into commodities of II<i>c</i>, would otherwise grow more
rapidly than II<i>c</i>, for which it can alone be exchanged.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Yet the figures we have quoted fail to show a quicker accumulation
in Department II, and in fact show it to fluctuate. Here
the principle seems to be as follows: Marx enables accumulation
to continue by broadening the basis of production in Department
I. Accumulation in Department II appears only as a condition
and consequence of accumulation in Department I:
absorbing, in the first place, the other&#8217;s surplus means of production
and supplying it, secondly, with the necessary surplus of
consumer goods for its additional labour. Department I retains
the initiative all the time, Department II being merely a passive
follower. Thus the capitalists of Department II are only allowed
to accumulate just as much as, and are made to consume no
less than, is needed for the accumulation of Department I.
While in Department I half the surplus value is capitalised
every time, and the other half consumed, so that there is an
orderly expansion both of production and of personal consumption
by the capitalists, the twofold process in Department II
takes the following erratic course:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="14">

<tr><td align="left">5th</td><td align="center">320</td><td></td><td align="center">745</td><td></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Here there is no rule in evidence for accumulation and consumption
to follow; both are wholly subservient to the requirements
of accumulation in Department I.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the absolute figures of the diagram are
arbitrary in every equation, but that does not detract from their
scientific value. It is the <i>quantitative ratios</i> which are relevant,
since they are supposed to express strictly determinate relationships.
Those precise logical rules that lay down the relations of
accumulation in Department I, seem to have been gained at
the cost of any kind of principle in construing these relations for
Department II; and this circumstance calls for a revision of the
immanent connections revealed by the analysis.</p>

<p>It might, however, be permissible to assume the defect to lie
in a rather unhappy choice of example. Marx himself, dissatisfied
with the diagram quoted above, proceeded forthwith
to give a second example in order to elucidate the movements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
of accumulation, where the figures of the equation run in the
following order:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="15">
<tr><td align="right">I.</td><td align="right">5,000<i>c</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,000<i>v</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,000<i>s</i></td><td align="right">=</td><td align="right">7,000</td></tr>

<tr><td align="right" colspan="7">Total:</td><td align="right" class="topb">9,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In contrast to the previous example, the capital of both
departments is here seen to have the same composition, i.e.
constant and variable capital are in a ratio of 5 to 1. This
already presupposes a considerable development of capitalist
production, and accordingly of social labour productivity&mdash;a
considerable preliminary expansion of the scale of production,
and finally, a development of all the circumstances which
bring about a relatively redundant surplus population in the
working class. We are no longer introduced to enlarged reproduction,
as in the first example, at the stage of the original
transition from simple to enlarged reproduction&mdash;the only point
of that is in any case for the sake of abstract theory. This time,
we are brought face to face with the process of accumulation
as it goes on at a definite and rather advanced stage of development.
It is perfectly legitimate to assume these conditions, and
they in no way distort the principles we must employ in order to
work out the individual loops of the reproductive spiral. Here
again Marx takes for a starting point the capitalisation of half
the surplus value in Department I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Now take it that the capitalist class of I consumes one-half of
the surplus-value, or 500, and accumulates the other half. In
that case (1,000<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ 500<i>s</i>) I, or 1,500, must be converted into
1,500 II<i>c</i>. Since II<i>c</i> amounts to only 1,430, it is necessary to take
70 from the surplus-value. Subtracting this sum from 285<i>s</i> leaves
215 II<i>s</i>. Then we have:</p>

<p>&#8216;I. 5,000<i>c</i>&nbsp;+ 500<i>s</i> (to be capitalised)&nbsp;+ 1,500 (<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>) in the fund
set aside for consumption by capitalists and labourers.</p>

<p>&#8216;II. 1,430<i>c</i>&nbsp;+ 70<i>s</i> (to be capitalised)&nbsp;+ 285<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ 215<i>s</i>. As 70 II<i>s</i>
are directly annexed by II<i>c</i>, a variable capital of 70&nbsp;: 5, or 14,
is required to set this additional constant capital in motion.
These 14 must come out of the 215<i>s</i>, so that only 201 remain,
and we have:</p>

<p>&#8216;II (1,430)&nbsp;+ 70<i>c</i>&nbsp;+ (285<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ 14<i>v</i>)&nbsp;+ 201<i>s</i>.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
After these preliminary arrangements, capitalisation can now
proceed. This is done as follows:</p>

<p>In Department I the 500<i>s</i> which have been capitalised are
divided into five-sixths (417<i>c</i>)&nbsp;+ one-sixth (83<i>v</i>). These 83<i>v</i>
withdraw a corresponding amount from II<i>s</i> which serves to
buy units of constant capital and thus accrues to II<i>c</i>. An
increase of II<i>c</i> by 83 involves the necessity of an increase in
II<i>v</i> by 17 (one-fifth of 83). After the completion of this turnover
we therefore have:</p>

by one-twelfth; in Department II it has grown from 1,715 to
1,899, i.e. by just over one-ninth.</p>

<p>At the end of the next year, the results of reproduction on this
basis are:</p>

<p>In the course of three years, the total social capital has increased
from I.6,000&nbsp;+ II.1,715&nbsp;= 7,715 to I.7,629&nbsp;+ II.2,229&nbsp;=
9,858, and the total product from 9,000 to 11,500.</p>

<p>Accumulation in both departments here proceeds uniformly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
in marked difference from the first example. From the second
year onwards, both departments capitalise half their surplus
value and consume the other half. A bad choice of figures in the
first example thus seems to be responsible for its arbitrary
appearance. But we must check up to make sure that it is not
only a mathematical manipulation with cleverly chosen figures
which this time ensures the smooth progress of accumulation.</p>

<p>In the first as well as in the second example, we are continually
struck by a seemingly general rule of accumulation: to make
any accumulation possible, Department II must always enlarge
its constant capital by precisely the amount by which Department
I increases (<i>a</i>) the proportion of surplus value for consumption
and (<i>b</i>) its variable capital. If we take the example of
the first year as an illustration, the constant capital of Department
II must be increased by 70. And why? because this capital
was only 1,430 before.</p>

<p>But if the capitalists of Department I wish to accumulate half
their surplus value (1,000) and to consume the other half, they
need consumer goods for themselves and for their workers to the
tune of 1,500 units which they can obtain only from Department
II in exchange for their own products&mdash;means of production.
Since Department II has already satisfied its own demand
for producer goods to the extent of its own constant capital
(1,430), this exchange is only possible if Department II decides
to enlarge its own constant capital by 70. This means that it
must enlarge its own production&mdash;and it can do so only by
capitalising a corresponding part of its surplus value. If this
surplus value amounts to 285 in Department II, 70 of it must be
added to the constant capital. The first step towards expansion
of production in Department II is thus demonstrated to be at
the same time the condition for, and the consequence of, increased
consumption by the capitalists of Department I. But to
proceed. Hitherto, the capitalists of Department I could only
spend one-half of their surplus value (500) on personal consumption.
To capitalise the other half, they must redistribute these
500<i>s</i> in such a way as to maintain at least the previous ratio of
composition, i.e. they must increase the constant capital by 417
and the variable capital by 83. The first operation presents no
difficulties: the surplus value of 500 belonging to the capitalists
of Department I is contained in a natural form in their own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
product, the means of production, and is fit straightway to enter
into the process of production; Department I can therefore
enlarge its constant capital with the appropriate quantity of its
own product. But the remaining 83 can only be used as variable
capital if there is a corresponding quantity of consumer goods
for the newly employed workers. Here it becomes evident for the
second time that accumulation in Department I is dependent
upon Department II: Department I must receive for its workers
83 more consumer goods than before from Department II. As
this is again possible only by way of commodity exchange,
Department I can satisfy its demands only on condition that
Department II is prepared for its part to take up products of
Department I, producer goods, to the tune of 83. Since Department
II has no use for the means of production except to employ
them in the process of production, it becomes not only
possible but even necessary that Department II should increase
its own constant capital by these very 83 which will now be
used for capitalisation and are thus again withdrawn from the
consumable surplus value of this department. The increase in
the variable capital of Department I thus entails the second
step in the enlargement of production in Department II. All
material prerequisites of accumulation in Department I are now
present and enlarged reproduction can proceed. Department II,
however, has so far made only two increases in its constant
capital. The result of this enlargement is that if the newly
acquired means of production are indeed to be used, the
quantity of labour power must be increased correspondingly.
Maintaining the previous ratio, the new constant capital of 153
requires a new variable capital of 31. This implies the necessity
to capitalise a corresponding further amount of the surplus
value. Thus the fund for the capitalists&#8217; personal consumption in
Department II comes to be what remains of the surplus value
(285<i>s</i>) after deduction of the amounts used for twice enlarging
the constant capital (70&nbsp;+ 83) and a commensurate increase in
the variable capital (31)&mdash;a fund of 101, after deducting a total
of 184. Similar operations in the second year of accumulation
result for Department II in its surplus value being divided into
158 for capitalisation and 158 for the consumption of its capitalists,
and in the third year, the figures become 172 and 170
respectively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
We have studied this process so closely, tracing it step by
step, because it shows clearly that the accumulation of Department
II is completely determined and dominated by the
accumulation of Department I. Though this dependence is no
longer expressed, as in Marx&#8217;s first example, by arbitrary changes
in the distribution of the surplus value, it does not do away
with the fact itself, even if now the surplus value is always neatly
halved by each department, one-half for capitalisation and the
other for personal consumption. Though there is nothing to
choose between the capitalists of the two departments as far as
the figures are concerned, it is quite obvious that Department I
has taken the initiative and actively carries out the whole
process of accumulation, while Department II is merely a passive
appendage. This dependence is also expressed in the following
precise rule: accumulation must proceed simultaneously in both
departments, and it can do so only on condition that the provisions-department
increases its constant capital by the precise
amount by which the capitalists of the means-of-production-department
increase both their variable capital and their fund
for personal consumption. This equation (increase II<i>c</i>&nbsp;= increase
I<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ increase I<i>s</i>.<i>c</i>.)<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>  is the mathematical cornerstone of Marx&#8217;s
diagram of accumulation, no matter what figures we may
choose for its concrete application. But now we must see whether
capitalist accumulation does in actual fact conform to this hard
and fast rule.</p>

<p>Let us first return to simple reproduction. Marx&#8217;s diagram, it
will be remembered, was as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="19">
<tr><td align="right">I.</td><td align="right">4,000<i>c</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,000<i>v</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,000<i>s</i></td><td align="right">=</td><td align="right">6,000</td><td align="left">means of production</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">II.</td><td align="right">2,000<i>c</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">500<i>v</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">500<i>s</i></td><td align="right">=</td><td align="right">3,000</td><td align="left">means of consumption</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right" colspan="7"></td><td align="right" class="topb">9,000</td><td align="left">total production</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Here, too, we established certain equations which form the
foundation of simple reproduction; they were:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The product of Department I equals in value the sum of
the two constant capitals in Departments I and II.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The constant capital of Department II equals the sum of
variable capital and surplus value in Department I&mdash;a necessary
consequence of (<i>a</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
(<i>c</i>) The product of Department II equals the sum of variable
capital and surplus value in both departments&mdash;a necessary
consequence of (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>).</p>

<p>These equations correspond to the conditions of capitalist
commodity production (at the restricted level of simple reproduction,
however). Equation (<i>b</i>), for instance, is a result of the
production of commodities, entailed by the fact, in other words,
that the entrepreneurs of either department can only obtain the
products of the other by an exchange of equivalents. Variable
capital and surplus value in Department I together represent
the demand of this department for consumer goods. The product
of Department II must provide for the satisfaction of this
demand, but consumer goods can only be obtained in exchange
for an equivalent part of the product of Department I, the
means of production. These equivalents, useless to Department
II in their natural form if not employed as constant
capital in the process of production, will thus determine how
much constant capital there is to be in Department II. If this
proportion were not adhered to, if, e.g., the constant capital of
Department II (as a quantity of value) were larger than I(<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>),
then it could not be completely transformed into means of production,
since the demand of Department I for consumer goods
would be too small; if the constant capital (II) were smaller
than I(<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>.<i>c</i>), either the previous quantity of labour power
could not be employed in this department, or the capitalists
could not consume the whole of their surplus value. In all these
cases, the premises of simple reproduction would be violated.</p>

<p>These equations, however, are not just an exercise in mathematics,
nor do they merely result from the system of commodity
production. To convince us of this fact, there is a simple
means at hand. Let us imagine for a moment that, instead of
a capitalist method of production, we have a socialist, i.e. a
planned society in which the social division of labour has come
to replace exchange. This society also will divide its labour
power into producers of means of production and producers of
means of consumption. Let us further imagine the technical
development of labour to be such that two-thirds of social labour
are employed in the manufacture of producer goods and one-third
in the manufacture of consumer goods. Suppose that
under these conditions 1,500 units (reckoned on a daily,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
monthly, or yearly basis) suffice to maintain the whole working
population of the society, one thousand of these being employed,
according to our premise, in Department soc. I (making means
of production), and five hundred in Department soc. II (making
consumer goods), and that the means of production dating from
previous labour periods and used up during one year&#8217;s labour,
represent 3,000 labour units. This labour programme, however,
would not be adequate for the society, since considerably more
labour will be needed to maintain all those of its members who
do not work in the material, the productive sense of the term:
the child, the old and sick, the civil servant, the artist and the
scientist. Moreover, every society needs certain reserves against
a rainy day, as a protection against natural calamities. Taking
it that precisely the same quantity of labour and, similarly, of
means of production as that required for the workers&#8217; own maintenance
is needed to maintain all the non-workers and to build
up the reserves, then, from the figures previously assumed, we
should get the following diagram for a regulated production:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="20">
<tr><td align="right">I.</td><td align="right">4,000<i>c</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,000<i>v</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,000<i>s</i></td><td align="right">=</td><td align="right">6,000</td><td align="left">means of production</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">II.</td><td align="right">2,000<i>c</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">500<i>v</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">500<i>s</i></td><td align="right">=</td><td align="right">3,000</td><td align="left">means of consumption</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Here <i>c</i> stands for the material means of production that have
been used, expressed in terms of social labour time; <i>v</i> stands for
the social labour time necessary to maintain the workers themselves
and <i>s</i> for that needed to maintain those who do not work
and to build up the reserves.</p>

<p>If we check up on the proportions of this diagram, we obtain
the following result: there is neither commodity production nor
exchange, but in truth a social division of labour. The products
of Department I are assigned to the workers of Department II
in the requisite quantities, and the products of Department II
are apportioned to everyone, worker or no, in both departments,
and also to the reserve-fund; all this being the outcome
not of an exchange of equivalents but of a social organisation
that plans and directs the process as a whole&mdash;because existing
demands must be satisfied and production knows no other end
but to satisfy the demands of society.</p>

<p>Yet all that does not detract from the validity of the equations.
The product of Department I must equal I<i>c</i>&nbsp;+ II<i>c</i>: this means
simply that Department I must annually renew all the means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
of production which society has used up during one year&#8217;s
labour. The product of Department II must equal the sum of
I(<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>)&nbsp;+ II(<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>): this means that society must each year produce
as many consumer goods as are required by all its members,
whether they work or not, plus a quota for the reserve
fund. The proportions of the diagram are as natural and as
inevitable for a planned economy as they are for a capitalist
economy based upon anarchy and the exchange of commodities.
This proves the diagram to have objective social validity,
even if, just because it concerns <i>simple</i> reproduction, it has
hardly more than theoretical interest for either a capitalist or
a planned economy, finding practical application only in the
rarest of cases.</p>

<p>The same sort of scrutiny must now be turned on the diagram
of enlarged reproduction. Taking Marx&#8217;s second example as the
basis for our test, let us again imagine a socialist society. From
the point of view of a regulated society we shall, of course, have
to start with Department II, not with Department I. Assuming
this society to grow rapidly, the result will be an increasing
demand for provisions by its members, whether they work or
not. This demand is growing so quickly that a constantly increasing
quantity of labour&mdash;disregarding for the moment the
progress of labour productivity&mdash;will be needed for the production
of consumer goods. The quantities required, expressed in
terms of social labour incorporated in them, increase from year
to year in a progression of, say, 2,000&nbsp;: 2,215&nbsp;: 2,399&nbsp;: 2,600 and
so on. Let us further assume that technical conditions demand
an increasing amount of means of production for producing this
growing quantity of provisions, which, again measured in terms
of social labour, mounts from year to year in the following progression:
7,000&nbsp;: 7,583&nbsp;: 8,215&nbsp;: 8,900 and so on. To achieve this
enlargement of production, we must further have a growth in
the labour performed <i>per annum</i> according to the following progression:
2,570&nbsp;: 2,798&nbsp;: 3,030&nbsp;: 3,284. [The figures correspond to
the respective amounts of I(<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>)&nbsp;+ II(<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>).] Finally, the labour
performed annually must be so distributed that one-half is
always used for maintaining the workers themselves, a quarter
for maintaining those who do not work, and the last quarter for
the purpose of enlarging production in the following year. Thus
we obtain the proportions of Marx&#8217;s second diagram of enlarged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
reproduction for a socialist society. In fact, three conditions are
indispensable if production is to be enlarged in any society, even
in a planned economy: (1) the society must have an increasing
quantity of labour power at its disposal; (2) in every working
period, the immediate needs of society must not claim the
whole of its working time, so that part of the time can be devoted
to making provision for the future and its growing
demands; (3) means of production must be turned out year
after year in sufficiently growing quantities&mdash;without which
production cannot be enlarged on a rising scale. In respect
of all these general points, Marx&#8217;s diagram of enlarged reproduction
has objective validity&mdash;<i>mutatis mutandis</i>&mdash;for a planned
society.</p>

<p>It remains to test whether it is also valid for a capitalist
economy. Here we must ask first of all: what is the starting point
of accumulation? That is the approach on which we have to
investigate the mutual dependence of the accumulative process
in the two departments of production. There can be no doubt
that under capitalist conditions Department II is dependent
upon Department I in so far as its accumulation is determined
by the additional means of production available. Conversely,
the accumulation in Department I depends upon a corresponding
quantity of additional consumer goods being available for
its additional labour power. It does not follow, however, that
so long as both these conditions are observed, accumulation in
both departments is bound, as Marx&#8217;s diagram makes it appear,
to go on automatically year after year. The conditions of
accumulation we have enumerated are no more than those
without which there can be no accumulation. There may even
be a desire to accumulate in both departments, yet the desire to
accumulate plus the technical prerequisites of accumulation is
not enough in a capitalist economy of commodity production.
A further condition is required to ensure that accumulation can
in fact proceed and production expand: the effective demand
for commodities must also increase. Where is this continually
increasing demand to come from, which in Marx&#8217;s
diagram forms the basis of reproduction on an ever rising
scale?</p>

<p>It cannot possibly come from the capitalists of Departments
I and II themselves&mdash;so much is certain right away&mdash;it cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
arise out of their personal consumption. On the contrary, it is
the very essence of accumulation that the capitalists refrain from
consuming a part of their surplus value which must be ever
increasing&mdash;at least as far as absolute figures are concerned&mdash;that
they use it instead to make goods for the use of other people.
It is true that with accumulation the personal consumption of
the capitalist class will grow and that there may even be an
increase in the total value consumed; nevertheless it will still
be no more than a part of the surplus value that is used for
the capitalists&#8217; consumption. That indeed is the foundation of
accumulation: the capitalists&#8217; abstention from consuming the
whole of their surplus value. But what of the remaining surplus
value, the part that is accumulated? For whom can it be
destined? According to Marx&#8217;s diagram, Department I has the
initiative: the process starts with the production of producer
goods. And who requires these additional means of production?
The diagram answers that Department II needs them in order
to produce means of consumption in increased quantities. Well
then, who requires these additional consumer goods? Department
I, of course&mdash;replies the diagram&mdash;because it now employs
a greater number of workers. We are plainly running in circles.
From the capitalist point of view it is absurd to produce more
consumer goods merely in order to maintain more workers, and
to turn out more means of production merely to keep this surplus
of workers occupied. Admittedly, as far as the individual
capitalist is concerned, the worker is just as good a consumer,
i.e. purchaser of his commodity, as another capitalist or anyone
else, provided that he can pay. Every individual capitalist
realises his surplus value in the price of his commodity, whether
he sells it to the worker or to some other buyer. But this does not
hold true from the point of view of the capitalist class as a whole.
The working class in general receives from the capitalist class no
more than an assignment to a determinate part of the social
product, precisely to the extent of the variable capital. The
workers buying consumer goods therefore merely refund to the
capitalist class the amount of the wages they have received, their
assignment to the extent of the variable capital. They cannot
return a groat more than that; and if they are in a position to
save in order to make themselves independent as small entrepreneurs,
they may even return less, though this is the exception.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Part of the surplus value is consumed by the capitalist class
itself in form of consumer goods, the money exchanged for these
being retained in the capitalists&#8217; pockets. But who can buy the
products incorporating the other, the capitalised part of the
surplus value? Partly the capitalists themselves&mdash;the diagram
answers&mdash;who need new means of production for the purpose
of expanding production, and partly the new workers who will
be needed to work these new means of production. But that
implies a previous capitalist incentive to enlarge production; if
new workers are set to work with new means of production,
there must have been a new demand for the products which are
to be turned out.</p>

<p>Perhaps the answer is that the natural increase of the population
creates this growing demand. In fact, the growth of the
population and its needs provided the starting point for our
examination of enlarged reproduction in an hypothetical
socialist society. There the requirements of society could serve
as an adequate basis, since the only purpose of production was
the satisfaction of wants. In a capitalist society, however, the
matter is rather different. What kind of people are we thinking
of when we speak of an increase in the population? There are
only two classes of the population according to Marx&#8217;s diagram,
the capitalists and the workers. The natural increase of the
former is already catered for by that part of the surplus value
which is consumed inasmuch as it increases in absolute quantity.
In any case, it cannot be the capitalists who consume the remainder,
since capitalist consumption of the entire surplus value
would mean a reversion to simple reproduction. That leaves the
workers, their class also growing by natural increase. Yet a
capitalist economy is not interested in this increase for its own
sake, as a starting point of growing needs.</p>

<p>The production of consumer goods for I<i>v</i> and II<i>v</i> is not an
end in itself, as it would be in a society where the economic
system is shaped for the workers and the satisfaction of their
wants. In a capitalist system, Department II does not produce
means of consumption in large quantities simply to keep the
workers of Departments I and II. Quite the contrary: a certain
number of workers in Departments I and II can support themselves
in every case because their labour power is useful under
the obtaining conditions of supply and demand. This means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
that the starting point of capitalist production is not a given
number of workers and their demands, but that these factors
themselves are constantly fluctuating, &#8216;dependent variables&#8217; of
the capitalist expectations of profit. The question is therefore
whether the natural increase of the working class also entails a
growing effective demand over and above the variable capital.
And that is quite impossible. The only source of money for the
working class in our diagram is the variable capital which must
therefore provide in advance for the natural increase of the
workers. One way or the other: either the older generation must
earn enough to keep their offspring&mdash;who cannot, then, count
as additional consumers; or, failing that, the next generation,
the young workers, must turn to work in order to obtain wages
and means of subsistence for themselves&mdash;in which case the new
working generation is already included in the number of
workers employed. On this count, the process of accumulation
in Marx&#8217;s diagram cannot be explained by the natural increase
of the population.</p>

<p>But wait! Even under the sway of capitalism, society does not
consist exclusively of capitalists and wage labourers. Apart from
these two classes, there are a host of other people: the landowners,
the salaried employees, the liberal professions such as
doctors, lawyers, artists and scientists. Moreover, there is the
Church and its servants, the Clergy, and finally the State with its
officials and armed forces. All these strata of the population can
be counted, strictly speaking, neither among the capitalist nor
among the working class. Yet society has to feed and support
them. Perhaps it is they, these strata apart from the capitalists
and wage labourers, who call forth enlarged reproduction by
their demand. But this seeming solution cannot stand up to a
closer scrutiny. The landowners must as consumers of rent, i.e.
of part of the surplus value, quite obviously be numbered among
the capitalist class; since we are here concerned with the surplus
value in its undivided, primary form, their consumption is
already allowed for in the consumption of the capitalist class.
The liberal professions in most cases obtain their money, i.e. the
assignment to part of the social product, directly or indirectly
from the capitalist class who pay them with bits of their own
surplus value. And the same applies to the Clergy, with the
difference only that its members also obtain their purchasing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
power in part from the workers, i.e. from wages. The upkeep of
the State, lastly, with its officers and armed forces is borne by the
rates and taxes, which are in their turn levied upon either the
surplus value or the wages. Within the limits of Marx&#8217;s diagram
there are in fact only the two sources of income in a society: the
labourers&#8217; wages and the surplus value. All the strata of the
population we have mentioned as apart from the capitalists and
the workers, are thus to be taken only for joint consumers of
these two kinds of income. Marx himself rejects any suggestion
that these &#8216;third persons&#8217; are more than a subterfuge:</p>

<p>&#8216;All members of society not directly engaged in reproduction,
with or without labour, can obtain their share of the annual
produce of commodities&mdash;in other words, their articles of consumption
... only out of the hands of those classes who are the
first to handle the product, that is to say, productive labourers,
industrial capitalists, and real estate owners. To that extent their
revenues are substantially derived from wages (of the productive
labourers), profit and ground rent, and appear as indirect
derivations when compared to these primary sources of revenue.
But, on the other hand, the recipients of these revenues, thus
indirectly derived, draw them by grace of their social functions,
for instance that of a king, priest, professor, prostitute, soldier,
etc., and they may regard these functions as the primary sources
of their revenue.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>And about the consumers of interest and ground rent as
buyers, Marx says: &#8216;Now, if that portion of the surplus-value of
commodities, which the industrial capitalist yields in the form
of ground rent or interest to other shareholders in the surplus-value,
cannot be in the long run converted into money by the
sale of the commodities, then there is an end to the payment of
rent and interest, and the landowners or recipients of interest
can no longer serve in the role of miraculous interlopers, who
convert aliquot portions of the annual reproduction into money
by spending their revenue. The same is true of the expenditure
of all so-called unproductive labourers, State officials, physicians,
lawyers, etc., and others who serve economists as an excuse
for explaining inexplicable things, in the role of the &#8216;general
public&#8217;.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Seeing that we cannot discover within capitalist society any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
buyers whatever for the commodities in which the accumulated
part of the surplus value is embodied, only one thing is left:
foreign trade. But there are a great many objections to a method
that conceives of foreign trade as a convenient dumping ground
for commodities which cannot be found any proper place in the
reproductive process. Recourse to foreign trade really begs
the question: the difficulties implicit in the analysis are simply
shifted&mdash;quite unresolved&mdash;from one country to another. Yet if
the analysis of the reproductive process actually intends not any
single capitalist country but the capitalist world market, there
can be no foreign trade: all countries are &#8216;home&#8217;. This point is
made by Marx already in the first volume of <i>Capital</i>, in connection
with accumulation:</p>

<p>&#8216;We here take no account of export trade, by means of which
a nation can change articles of luxury either into means of production
or means of subsistence, and <i>vice versa</i>. In order to
examine the object of our investigation in its integrity, free from
all disturbing subsidiary circumstances, we must treat the whole
world as one nation and assume that capitalist production is
everywhere established and has possessed itself of every branch
of industry.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>The same difficulty presents itself if we consider the matter
from yet another aspect. In Marx&#8217;s diagram of accumulation we
assumed that the portion of the social surplus value intended
for accumulation exists from the first in a natural form which
demands it to be used for capitalisation.</p>

<p>&#8216;In one word, surplus-value is convertible into capital solely
because the surplus-product, whose value it is, already comprises
the material elements of new capital.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>In the figures of our diagram:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="21">
<tr><td align="right">I.</td><td align="right">5,000<i>c</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,000<i>v</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,000<i>s</i></td><td align="right">=</td><td align="right">7,000</td><td align="left">means of production</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">II.</td><td align="right">1,430<i>c</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">285<i>v</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">285<i>s</i></td><td align="right">=</td><td align="right">2,000</td><td align="left">means of consumption</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Here, a surplus value of 570<i>s</i> can be capitalised because from
the very outset it consists in means of production. To this
quantity of producer goods there correspond besides additional
consumer goods to the amount of 114<i>s</i> so that 684<i>s</i> can be
capitalised in all. But the process here assumed of simply transferring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
means of production to constant capital on the one hand,
consumer goods to variable capital on the other, in commensurate
quantities, is in contradiction with the very structure of
capitalist commodity production. Whatever natural form the
surplus value may have, there can be no immediate transfer to
the place of production for the purpose of accumulation. It must
first be realised, it must be turned into hard cash.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Of the surplus value in Department I, 500 are fit to be capitalised,
but not until they have first been realised; the surplus
value has to shed its natural form and assume the form of pure
value before it can be added to productive capital. This is true
for each individual capitalist and also for the &#8216;aggregate capitalist&#8217;
of society, it being a prime condition for capitalist production
that the surplus value must be realised in the form of pure
value. Accordingly, regarding reproduction from the point of
view of society as a whole&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;We must not follow the manner copied by Proudhon from
bourgeois economy, which looks upon this matter as though a
society with a capitalist mode of production would lose its
specific historical and economic characteristics by being taken
as a unit. Not at all. We have, in that case, to deal with the
aggregate capitalist.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>The surplus value must therefore shed its form as surplus product
before it can re-assume it for the purpose of accumulation;
by some means or other it must first pass through the money
stage. So the surplus product of Departments I and II must be
bought&mdash;by whom? On the above showing, there will have to
be an effective demand outside I and II, merely in order to
realise the surplus value of the two departments, just so that the
surplus product can be turned to cash. Even then, we should
only have got to the stage where the surplus value has become
money. If this realised surplus value is further to be employed in
the process of enlarging reproduction, in accumulation, an even
larger demand must be expected for the future, a demand which
is again to come from outside the two departments. Either the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
demand for the surplus product will therefore have to increase
annually in accordance with the rate of increase of the accumulated
surplus value, or&mdash;<i>vice versa</i>&mdash;accumulation can only proceed
precisely in so far as the demand outside I and II is
rising.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER VIII</i></h2>

<h2>MARX&#8217;S ATTEMPT
TO RESOLVE THE DIFFICULTY</h2>

<p>Complete abstraction from the circulation of money,
though making the process of accumulation so smooth
and simple in the diagram of enlarged reproduction, has
great disadvantages of its own, we see. There was much to be
said for this method in the analysis of simple reproduction,
where consumption is the be-all and end-all of production.
Money there had an ephemeral part, mediating the distribution
of the social product among the various groups of consumers&mdash;the
agent for the renewal of capital. In the process of accumulation,
however, the money form has an essential function: it no
longer serves as a mere agent in the circulation of commodities&mdash;here
it has come to be a feature of capital itself, an element in
the circulation of capital. Even if the transformation of the
surplus value is not essential to real reproduction, it is the
economic <i>sine qua non</i> of capitalist accumulation. In the transition
from production to reproduction, the surplus product is thus
subjected to two metamorphoses: first it casts off its use-form
and then it assumes a natural form which is fit for the purpose
of accumulation. The point here is not that the different cycles
of production are counted off in units of years. It would be just
as well to take the month; for that matter, the successive transformation
of individual portions of the surplus value in Departments
I and II may even intersect in time. Series of years here
do not mean units of time but really intend the sequence of
economic transformations. What matters is that this sequence
must be observed if accumulation is to keep its capitalist character,
whether it extends over a longer or a shorter period of
time. This brings us back to the old question: How, and by
whom, is the accumulated surplus value to be realised?</p>

<p>Marx was well aware that his seemingly water-tight scheme
of accumulation did not cover this point adequately, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
himself kept reviewing the problem from various angles. What
he says is this:</p>

<p>&#8216;It has been shown in volume i, how accumulation works in
the case of the individual capitalist. By the conversion of the
commodity-capital into money, the surplus-product, in which
the surplus-value is incorporated, is also monetised. The capitalist
reconverts the surplus-value thus monetised into additional
natural elements of his productive capital. In the next cycle of
production the increased capital furnishes an increased product.
But what happens in the case of the individual capital, must
also show in the annual reproduction of society as a whole, just
as we have seen it does in the case of reproduction on a simple
scale, where the successive precipitation of the depreciated
elements of fixed capital in the form of money, accumulated as
a hoard, also makes itself felt in the annual reproduction of
society.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>He examines the mechanism of accumulation further from
this very point of view, focusing on the fact that surplus value
must pass through the money stage before it is accumulated.</p>

<p>&#8216;For instance, capitalist A, who sells during one year, or
during a number of successive years, certain quantities of commodities
produced by him, thereby converts that portion of the
commodities, which bears surplus-value, the surplus-product,
or, in other words, the surplus-value produced by himself,
successively into money, accumulates it gradually, and thus
makes for himself a new potential money-capital. It is potential
money-capital on account of its capacity and destination of
being converted into the elements of productive capital. But
practically he merely accumulates a simple hoard, which is not
an element of actual production. His activity for the time being
consists only in withdrawing circulating money out of circulation.
Of course, it is not impossible that the circulating money
thus laid away by him was itself, before it entered into circulation,
a portion of some other hoard.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>  &#8216;Money is withdrawn
from circulation and accumulated as a hoard by the sale of commodities
without a subsequent purchase. If this operation is
conceived as one taking place universally, then it seems inexplicable
where the buyers are to come from, since in that case
everybody would want to sell in order to hoard, and no one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
would want to buy. And it must be so conceived, since every
individual capital may be in process of accumulation.</p>

<p>&#8216;If we were to conceive of the process of circulation as one
taking place in a straight line between the various divisions of
annual reproduction&mdash;which would be incorrect as it consists
with a few exceptions of mutually retroactive movements&mdash;then
we should have to start out from the producer of gold (or silver)
who buys without selling, and to assume that all others sell to
him. In that case, the entire social surplus-product of the
current year would pass into his hands, representing the entire
surplus-value of the year, and all the other capitalists would
distribute among themselves their relative shares in his surplus-product,
which consists naturally of money, gold being the
natural form of his surplus-value. For that portion of the product
of the gold producer, which has to make good his active capital,
is already tied up and disposed of. The surplus-value of the gold
producer, in the form of gold, would then be the only fund from
which all other capitalists would have to derive the material for
the conversion of their annual surplus-product into gold. The
magnitude of its value would then have to be equal to the entire
annual surplus-value of society, which must first assume the
guise of a hoard. Absurd as this assumption would be, it would
accomplish nothing more than to explain the possibility of a
universal formation of a hoard at the same period. It would not
further reproduction itself, except on the part of the gold producer,
by one single step.</p>

<p>&#8216;Before we solve this <i>seeming difficulty</i>, we must distinguish....&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>The obstacle in the way of realising the surplus value which
Marx here calls a &#8216;seeming difficulty&#8217; nevertheless is important
enough for the whole further discussion in <i>Capital</i>, volume ii,
to be concentrated on overcoming it. As a first attempt, Marx
proffers the solution of a hoard which, owing to the separation
of the different individual constant capitals in the process of
circulation, will inevitably be formed in a capitalist system of
production. Inasmuch as different capital investments have
different spans of life, and there is always an interval before the
parts of a plant are due for renewal, at any given moment we
may find that one individual capitalist is already busy renewing
his plant, while another is still building up reserves from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
proceeds yielded by the sale of his commodities against the day
when he will have enough to renew his fixed capital.</p>

<p>&#8216;For instance, let A sell 600, representing 400<i>c</i>&nbsp;+ 100<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ 100<i>s</i>
to B, who may represent more than one buyer. A sells 600 in
commodities for 600 in money, of which 100 are surplus-value
which he withdraws from circulation and hoards in the form of
money. But these 100 in money are but the money-form of the
surplus-product in which a value of 100 was incorporated.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>In order to comprehend the problem in complete purity,
Marx here assumes the whole of the surplus value to be capitalised,
for which reason he ignores altogether that part of the
surplus value is used for the capitalists&#8217; personal consumption;
in addition, A´, A´´ and A´´´ as well as B´, B´´ and B´´´ here
belong to Department I.</p>

<p>&#8216;The formation of a hoard, then, is not a production, nor is it
an increment of production. The action of the capitalist consists
merely in withdrawing from circulation 100 obtained by the
sale of his surplus-product, in holding and hoarding this amount.
This operation is carried on, not alone on the part of A, but at
numerous points of the periphery of circulation by other capitalists
named A´, A´´, A´´´.... However, A accomplishes the
formation of a hoard only to the extent that he acts as a seller,
so far as his surplus-product is concerned, not as a buyer. His
successive production of surplus-products, the bearers of his
surplus-value convertible into money, is therefore a premise for
the formation of his hoard. In the present case, where we are
dealing only with the circulation within Department I, the
natural form of the surplus-product, and of the total product of
which it is a part, is that of an element of constant capital of I,
that is to say it belongs to the category of a means of production
creating means of production. We shall see presently what
becomes of it, what function it performs, in the hands of the
buyers such as B, B´, B´´, etc.</p>

<p>&#8216;It must particularly be noted at this point that A, while
withdrawing money from circulation and hoarding it, on the
other hand throws commodities into it without withdrawing
other commodities in return. The capitalists, B, B´, B´´, etc., are
thereby enabled to throw only money into it and withdraw only
commodities from it. In the present case, these commodities,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
according to their natural form and destination, become a fixed
or circulating element of the constant capital of B, B´, etc.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>There is nothing new about this whole process. Marx had
already described it extensively in connection with simple reproduction,
since it alone can explain how a society is able to
renew constant capital under conditions of capitalist reproduction.
How this process can lay the besetting problem of our
analysis of enlarged reproduction is far from self-evident. The
difficulty had been that for the purpose of accumulation, part
of the surplus value is not consumed by the capitalists but added
to capital in order to expand production, giving rise to the
question of buyers for this additional product. The capitalists do
not want to consume it and the workers are not able to do so,
their entire consumption being covered in every case by the
available variable capital. Whence the demand for the accumulated
surplus value? or, as Marx would have it: Whence the
money to pay for the accumulated surplus value?</p>

<p>If, by way of answer, we are referred to the process of hoarding
attendant upon the gradual renewal of the constant capital
by the individual capitalists at various times, the connection
between these two points remains obscure. As long as B, B´ and
B´´, etc., buy producer goods from their colleagues A, A´ and
A´´ in order to renew their constant capital that has in fact been
used up, the limits of simple reproduction are not transcended,
and the whole thing has nothing to do with our problem. The
moment the producer goods purchased by B, B´, B´´, etc., serve
to increase their constant capital, however, for purposes of
accumulation, a number of new questions clamour for attention.
First and foremost where do the B&#8217;s get the cash to buy an
additional product from the A&#8217;s? The only way they could have
made their money is by sale of their own surplus product.
Before they can acquire new means of production for expanding
their enterprises, before they appear as buyers, that is to say, of
the surplus product that is to be accumulated, they must first
have disposed of their own surplus product&mdash;in a word, B, B´,
B´´, etc., must have been vendors themselves. But who could
have bought their surplus product? It is obvious that the difficulty
is simply shifted from the A&#8217;s to the B&#8217;s without having
been mastered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
At one stage of the analysis it really does seem for a time as if
a solution were found at last. After a short digression, Marx
returns to the main line of his investigation in the following
words:</p>

<p>&#8216;In the present case, this surplus-product consists at the outset
of means of production used in the creation of means of production.
It is not until it reaches the hands of B, B´, B´´, etc.,
(I), that this surplus-product serves as an additional constant
capital. But it is virtually that even in the hands of the accumulators
of hoards, the capitalists A, A´, A´´, (I), before it is sold.
If we consider merely the volume of values of the reproduction
on the part of I, then we are still moving within the limits of
simple reproduction, for no additional capital has been set in
motion for the purpose of creating this virtual additional
capital (the surplus-product), nor has any greater amount of
surplus-labour been performed than that done on the basis of
simple reproduction. The difference is here only one of the form
of the surplus-labour performed, of the concrete nature of its
particularly useful service. It is expended in means of production
for Department I<i>c</i> instead of II<i>c</i>, in means of production of
means of production instead of means of production of articles
of consumption. In the case of simple reproduction it had been
assumed that the entire surplus-value was spent as revenue in
the commodities of II. Hence it consisted only of such means of
production as restore the constant capital of II<i>c</i> in its natural
form. In order that the transition from simple to expanded reproduction
may take place, the production in Department I
must be enabled to create fewer elements for the constant capital
of II and more for that of I.... Considering the matter merely
from the point of view of the volume of values, it follows, then,
that the material requirements of expanded reproduction are
produced within simple reproduction. It is simply a question of
the expenditure of the surplus-labour of the working class of I
for the production of means of production, the creation of
virtual additional capital of I. The virtual additional money-capital,
created on the part of A, A´, A´´, by the successive sale
of their surplus-product, which was formed without any capitalist
expenditure of money, is in this case simply the money-form
of the additional means of production made by I.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
On this interpretation, the difficulty seems to dissolve into
thin air at our touch. Accumulation requires no new sources of
money at all. Before, when the capitalists themselves consumed
their surplus value, they had to have a corresponding money
reserve in hand, the analysis of simple reproduction already
having proved that the capitalist class must itself put into circulation
the money needed for the realisation of their surplus
value. Now, instead of consumer goods, the capitalist class, or
rather B, B´, and B´´, buy an equivalent amount of means of
production in order to expand their production. In this way,
money to the same value is accumulated in the hands of the
other capitalist group, viz. A, A´, A´´, etc.</p>

<p>&#8216;This hoarding ... does not in any way imply an addition
to the wealth in precious metals, but only a change of function
on the part of money previously circulating. A while ago it
served as a medium of circulation, now it serves as a hoard, as
a virtual additional money-capital in process of formation.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>And that is that! Yet this way out of the difficulty is open to us
only on one condition, and that is not far to seek: Marx here
takes accumulation in its first rudiments, <i>in statu nascendi</i>, as it
begins to evolve from simple reproduction. In respect of the
amount of value, production is not yet enlarged, it has only been
rearranged so that its material elements are grouped in a different
way. That the sources of money also seem adequate is
therefore not surprising. This solution, however, is only true for
one specific moment, the period of transition from simple reproduction
to enlarged reproduction&mdash;in short, a moment that has
no reference to reality and can only be conceived speculatively.
Once accumulation has been established for some time, when
increasing amounts of value are thrown upon the market in
every period of production, buyers for these additional values
cannot fail to become a problem. And on this point the proffered
solution breaks down. For that matter, it was never more
than a seeming solution, <i>not a real one</i>. On closer scrutiny, it fails
us even at the precise instant it appears to have smoothed the
way for us. For if we take accumulation just at the very moment
of its emergence from simple reproduction, the prime condition
it demands is a decrease in the consumption of the capitalist
class. No sooner have we discovered a way to expand reproduction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
with the means of circulation already at hand, than we
find previous consumers trickling away at the same rate. What,
then, is the good of expanding production; who is there able to
buy from B, B´ and B´´ this increased amount of products which
they could turn out only by denying themselves the money they
need for buying new means of production from A, A´ and A´´?</p>

<p>That solution, we see, was a mere illusion&mdash;the difficulty still
persists. Marx himself at once re-opens the question where B,
B´ and B´´ get the money to buy the surplus product of A, A´
and A´´.</p>

<p>&#8216;To the extent that the products created by B, B´, B´´, etc.,
(I) re-enter in their natural form into their own process, it goes
without saying that a corresponding portion of their own
surplus-product is transferred directly (without any intervention
of circulation) to their productive capital and becomes an
element of additional constant capital. To the same extent they
do not help to convert any surplus-product of A, A´, A´´ etc.,
(I) into money. Aside from this, where does the money come
from? We know that they have formed their hoard in the same
way as A, A´, etc., by the sale of their respective surplus-products.
Now they have arrived at the point where their
accumulated hoard of virtual money-capital is to enter effectually
upon its function as additional money-capital. But this is
merely turning around in a circle. The question still remains:
Where does the money come from, which the various B&#8217;s (I)
withdrew from the circulation and accumulated?&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>His prompt reply again seems surprisingly simple: &#8216;Now we
know from the analysis of simple reproduction, that the capitalists
of I and II must have a certain amount of ready money
in their hands, in order to be able to dispose of their surplus-products.
In that case, the money which served only for the
spending of revenue in articles of consumption returned to the
capitalists in the same measure in which they advanced it for
the purpose of disposing of their commodities. Here the same
money reappears, but in a different function. The A&#8217;s and B&#8217;s
supply one another alternately with the money for converting
their surplus-product into virtual additional capital, and throw
the newly formed money-capital alternately into circulation as
a medium of purchase.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
That is harking back to simple reproduction all over again. It
is quite true, of course, that the capitalists A and the capitalists
B are constantly accumulating a hoard of money bit by bit so as
to be able to renew their constant (fixed) capital from time to
time, and in this way they really are assisting one another in
realising their products. Yet this accumulating hoard does not
drop from the clouds&mdash;it is simply a natural precipitation of the
fixed capital that is (in terms of value) continually being transferred
in instalments to the products which are then one by one
realised in the process of sale. Owing to its very nature, the
accumulated hoard can only cover the renewal of the old
capital; there cannot possibly be enough to serve further for
purchasing additional constant capital. That means that we are
still within the limits of simple reproduction. Perhaps, though,
that part of the medium of circulation which hitherto served
the capitalists for their personal consumption, and is now to be
capitalised, becomes a new source of additional money? For that
to be true, however, we should have to be back at the unique
and fleeting moment that has no more than theoretical existence&mdash;the
period of transition from simple to enlarged reproduction.
Beyond this gap accumulation cannot proceed&mdash;we are in truth
going round in circles.</p>

<p>So the capitalist hoarding will not do as a way out of our
difficulties. This conclusion should not come as a surprise, since
the very exposition of the difficulty was misleading. It is not the
source of money that constitutes the problem of accumulation,
but the source of the demand for the additional goods produced
by the capitalised surplus value; not a technical hitch in the
circulation of money but an economic problem pertaining to
the reproduction of the total social capital. Quite apart from
the question which had claimed Marx&#8217;s entire attention so far,
namely where B, B´, etc., (I), get the money to buy additional
means of production from A, A´, etc., (I), successful accumulation
will inevitably have to face a far more serious problem:
to whom can B, B´, etc., now sell their increased surplus-product?
Marx finally makes them sell their products to one
another:</p>

<p>&#8216;It may be that the different B, B´, B´´, etc., (I), whose virtual
new capital enters upon its active function, are compelled to
buy from one another their product (portions of their surplus-product)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
or to sell it to one another. In that case, the money
advanced by them for the circulation of their surplus-product
flows back under normal conditions to the different B&#8217;s in the
same proportion in which they advanced it for the circulation
of their respective commodities.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>&#8216;In that case&#8217;&mdash;the problem simply has not been solved, for
after all B, B´, and B´´ have not cut down on their consumption
and expanded their production just so as to buy each other&#8217;s
increased product, i.e. means of production. Even that, incidentally,
would only be possible to a very limited extent. Marx
assumes a certain division of labour in Department I itself: the
A&#8217;s turn out means of production for making producer goods
and the B&#8217;s means of production for making consumer goods,
which is as much as to say that, though the product of A, A´,
etc., need never leave Department I, the product of B, B´, etc.,
is by its natural form predestined from the first for Department
II. Already the accumulation of B, B´, etc., it follows, must
lead us to circulation between Departments I and II. Thus
Marx&#8217;s analysis itself confirms that, if Department I is to
accumulate, the department for means of consumption must, in
the last resort, increase its immediate or mediate demand for
means of production, and so it is to Department II and its
capitalists that we must look for buyers for the additional product
turned out by Department I.</p>

<p>Sure enough, Marx&#8217;s second attack on the problem takes up
from there: the demand of capitalists in Department II for
additional means of production. Such a demand inevitably
implies that the constant capital II<i>c</i> is in process of expanding.
This is where the difficulty becomes truly formidable:</p>

<p>&#8216;Take it now that A(I) converts his surplus-product into gold
by selling it to a capitalist B in Department II. This can be done
only by the sale of means of production on the part of A(I) to
B(II) without a subsequent purchase of articles of consumption,
in other words, only by a one-sided sale on A&#8217;s part. Now we
have seen that II<i>c</i> cannot be converted into the natural form of
productive constant capital unless not only I<i>v</i> but also at least
a portion of I<i>s</i>, is exchanged for a portion of II<i>c</i>, which II<i>c</i> exists
in the form of articles of consumption. But now that A has
converted his I<i>s</i> into gold by making this exchange impossible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
and withdrawing the money obtained from II<i>c</i> out of circulation,
instead of spending it for articles of consumption of II<i>c</i>,
there is indeed on the part of A(I) a formation of additional
virtual money-capital, but on the other hand there is a corresponding
portion of the value of the constant capital B(II) held
in the form of commodity-capital, unable to transform itself
into natural productive constant capital. In other words, a
portion of the commodities of B(II), and at that a portion
which must be sold if he wishes to reconvert his entire constant
capital into its productive form, has become unsaleable. To that
extent, there is an over-production which clogs reproduction,
even on the same scale.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>Department I&#8217;s efforts to accumulate by selling its additional
product to Department II have met with an unlooked-for result:
a deficit for the capitalists of Department II serious enough to
prevent even simple reproduction on the old scale.</p>

<p>Having got to this crucial point, Marx seeks to lay bare the
root of the problem by a careful and detailed exposition:</p>

<p>&#8216;Let us now take a closer look at the accumulation in Department
II. The first difficulty with reference to II<i>c</i>, that is
to say the conversion of an element of the commodity-capital
of II into the natural form of constant capital of II, concerns
simple reproduction. Let us take the formula previously used.
(1,000<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ 1,000<i>s</i>) I are exchanged for 2,000 II<i>c</i>. Now, if one half
of the surplus-product of I, or 500<i>s</i>, is reincorporated in Department
I as constant capital, then this portion, being detained
in Department I, cannot take the place of any portion of II<i>c</i>.
Instead of being converted into articles of consumption, it is
made to serve as an additional means of production in Department
I itself.... It cannot perform this function simultaneously
in I and II. The capitalist cannot spend the value of his surplus-product
for articles of consumption, and at the same time
consume the surplus-product itself productively, by incorporating
it in his productive capital. Instead of 2,000 I(<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>), only
1,500 are exchangeable for 2,000 II<i>c</i>, namely 1,000<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ 500<i>s</i> of I.
But 500 I<i>c</i> cannot, be reconverted from the form of commodities
into productive constant capital of II.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>By now, hardly anybody could fail to be convinced that the
difficulty is real, but we have not taken a single step nearer a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
solution. This, incidentally, is where Marx has to do penance
for his ill-advised continual recourse in an earlier over-simplification,
to a fictitious moment of transition&mdash;in order in elucidate
the problem of accumulation&mdash;from simple reproduction
to enlarged reproduction, making his major premise accumulation
at its very inception, in its feeble infancy instead its
vigorous stride. There was something to be said, at least, for this
fiction, so long as it was just a question of accumulation within
Department I. The capitalists of Department I, who denied
themselves part of what they had been wont to consume, at once
had a new hoard of money in hand with which they could start
capitalisation. But when it comes to Department II, the same
fiction only piles on the difficulties. The &#8216;abstinence&#8217; of the
capitalists in Department I here finds expression in a painful
loss of consumers for whose expected demand production had
largely been calculated. Since the capitalists of Department II,
on whom we tried the experiment whether they might not
possibly be the long-sought buyers of the additional product of
accumulation in Department I, are themselves in sore straits&mdash;not
knowing as yet where to go with their own unsold product&mdash;they
are even less likely to be of any help to us. There is no
shutting our eyes to the fact that an attempt to make one group
of capitalists accumulate at the expense of the other is bound to
get involved in glaring inconsistencies.</p>

<p>Yet another attempt to get round the difficulty is subsequently
mentioned by Marx who at once rejects it as a subterfuge.
The unmarketable surplus value in Department II that is
the result of accumulation in Department I might be considered
a reserve of commodities the society is going to need in the
course of the following year. This interpretation Marx counters
with his usual thoroughness:</p>

<p>&#8216;(1) ... the forming of such supplies and the necessity for it
applies to all capitalists, those of I as well as of II. Considering
them in their capacity as sellers of commodities, they differ only
by the fact that they sell different kinds of commodities. A
supply of commodities of II implies a previous supply of commodities
of I. If we neglect this supply on the one side, we must
also do so on the other. But if we count them in on both sides,
the problem is not altered in any way. (2) Just as this year closes
on the side of II with a supply of commodities for the next year,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
so it was opened by a supply of commodities on the same side,
taken over from last year. In the analysis of annual reproduction,
reduced to its abstract form, we must therefore strike it out
at both ends. By leaving this year in possession of its entire
production, including the supply held for next year, we take
from it the supply of commodities transferred from last year, and
thus we have actually to deal with the aggregate product of an
average year as the object of our analysis. (3) The simple
circumstance that the difficulty which must be overcome did
not show itself in the analysis of simple reproduction proves that
it is a specific phenomenon due merely to the different arrangement
of the elements of Department I with a view to reproduction,
an arrangement without which reproduction on an
expanded scale cannot take place at all.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>The last remark, be it noted, is equally damaging to his own
earlier attempt at resolving the specific difficulties of accumulation
by moments pertaining to simple reproduction, viz. the
formation of a hoard consequent upon the gradual turnover of
the fixed capital in the hands of the capitalists which was previously
adduced as the explanation of accumulation in Department
I.</p>

<p>Marx then proceeds to set out enlarged reproduction in the
form of diagrams. But no sooner does he begin to analyse his
diagram, than the same difficulty crops up anew in a slightly
different guise. Assuming that the capitalists of Department II
must for their part convert 140<i>s</i> into constant capital so as to
make accumulation possible for the others, he asks:</p>

<p>&#8216;Therefore Department II must buy 140<i>s</i> for cash without
recovering this money by a subsequent sale of its commodities to
I. And this is a process which is continually repeated in every
new annual production, so far as it is reproduction on an
enlarged scale. Where does II get the money for this?&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>In the following, Marx tries out various approaches in order
to discover this source. First the expenditure on variable capital
by the capitalists in Department II is closely scrutinised. True,
it exists in the form of money; but its proper function is the
purchase of labour power, and it cannot possibly be withdrawn
and made to serve, maybe, for purchasing additional means of
production.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
&#8216;This continually repeated departure from and return to the
starting point, the pocket of the capitalist, does not add in any
way to the money moving in this cycle. This, then, is not a
source of the accumulation of money.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>Marx then considers all conceivable dodges, only to show
them up as evading the issue.</p>

<p>&#8216;But stop!&#8217; he exclaims. &#8216;Isn&#8217;t there a chance to make a little
profit?&#8217;<a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>He considers whether the capitalists could not manage to save
a little of the variable capital by depressing the wages of the
workers below the normal average and thus to tap a new source
of money for accumulation. A mere flick of his fingers, of course,
disposes of this notion:</p>

<p>&#8216;But it must not be forgotten that the wages actually paid
(which determine the magnitude of the variable capital under
normal conditions) do not depend on the benevolence of
the capitalists, but must be paid under certain conditions.
This does away with this expedient as a source of additional
money.&#8217;<a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>He even explores what hidden methods there may be of
&#8216;saving&#8217; on the variable capital, such as the truck system, frauds,
etc., only to comment finally: &#8216;This is the same operation as
under (1), only disguised and carried out by a detour. Therefore
it must likewise be rejected as an explanation of the present
problem.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>All efforts to make the variable capital yield a new source of
money for the purpose of accumulation are thus unrewarded:
&#8216;In short, we cannot accomplish anything with 376 II<i>v</i> for the
solution of this question.&#8217;<a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>Marx next turns to the cash reserves which the capitalists in
Department II keep for the circulation of their own consumption
and investigates whether none of this money can be diverted
to the purposes of capitalisation. Yet this, he allows, is &#8216;still
more impossible&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here the capitalists of the same department are standing face
to face, heavily buying and selling their articles of consumption.
The money required for these transactions serves only as a
medium of circulation and must flow back to the interested
parties in the normal course of things, to the extent that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
have advanced it to the circulation, in order to pass again and
again over the same course.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>The next attempt to follow belongs, as was to have been
expected, to the category of those &#8216;subterfuges&#8217; which Marx
ruthlessly refutes: the attempt to explain that money-capital can
be formed in the hands of one capitalist group in Department II
by defrauding the other capitalists within the same department&mdash;viz.
in the process of the mutual selling of consumer goods. No
time need be wasted on this little effort.</p>

<p>Then comes a more sober proposition: &#8216;Or, a certain portion
of II<i>s</i>, represented by necessities of life, might be directly converted
into new variable capital of Department II.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>It is not quite clear how this can help us over the hurdle, help
to get accumulation going. For one thing, the formation of
additional variable capital in Department II is not much use
if we have no additional constant capital for this department,
being in fact engaged on the task of finding it. For another
thing, our present concern is to see if we can find in Department
II a source of money for the purchase of additional means
of production from I, and Department II&#8217;s problem how to
place its own additional product in some way or other in the
process of production is beside the point. Further, is the implication
that the respective consumer goods should be used
&#8216;direct&#8217;, i.e. without the mediation of money, in the production
of Department II, so that the corresponding amount of money
can be diverted from variable capital to the purpose of accumulation?
If so, we could not accept the solution. Under normal
conditions of capitalist production, the remuneration of the
workers by consumer goods direct is precluded, one of the
corner-stones of capitalist economy being the money-form of the
variable capital, the independent transaction between the
worker as buyer of commodities and producer of consumer
goods. Marx himself stresses this point in another context:</p>

<p>&#8216;We know that the actual variable capital consists of labour-power,
and therefore the additional must consist of the same
thing. It is not the capitalist of I who among other things buys
from II a supply of necessities of life for his labourers, or
accumulates them for this purpose, as the slave holder had to do.
It is the labourers themselves who trade with II.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
And that goes for the capitalists of Department II just as
much as for those of Department I, thus disposing of Marx&#8217;s last
effort.</p>

<p>Marx ends up by referring us to the last part of <i>Capital</i>,
volume ii, chapter 21, the &#8216;Concluding Remarks <i>sub iv</i>&#8217;, as
Engels has called them. Here we find the curt explanation:</p>

<p>&#8216;The original source for the money of II is <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> of the gold
producers in Department I, exchanged for a portion of II<i>c</i>.
Only to the extent that the gold producer accumulates surplus-value
or converts it into means of production of I, in other
words, to the extent that he expands his production, does his
<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> stay out of Department II. On the other hand, to the
extent that the accumulation of gold on the part of the gold
producer himself leads ultimately to an expansion of production,
a portion of the surplus-value of gold production not spent
as revenue passes into Department II as additional variable
capital of the gold producers, promotes the accumulation of
new hoards in II and supplies it with means by which to buy
from I without having to sell to it immediately.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>After the breakdown of all conceivable attempts at explaining
accumulation, therefore, after chasing from pillar to post, from
A I to B I, and from B I to A II, we are made to fall back in the
end on the very gold producer, recourse to whom Marx had at
the outset of his analysis branded as &#8216;absurd&#8217;. The analysis of
the reproductive process, and the second volume of <i>Capital</i>
finally comes to a close without having provided the long
sought-for solution to our difficulty.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER IX</i></h2>

<h2>THE DIFFICULTY VIEWED FROM THE
ANGLE OF THE PROCESS OF
CIRCULATION</h2>

<p>The flaw in Marx&#8217;s analysis is, in our opinion, the misguided
formulation of the problem as a mere question of
&#8216;the sources of money&#8217;, whereas the real issue is the effective
demand, the use made of goods, not the source of the
money which is paid for them. As to money as a means of circulation:
when considering the reproductive process as a whole,
we must assume that capitalist society must always dispose of
money, or a substitute, in just that quantity that is needed for
its process of circulation. What has to be explained is the great
social transaction of exchange, caused by real economic needs.
While it is important to remember that capitalist surplus value
must invariably pass through the money stage before it can be
accumulated, we must nevertheless try to track down the economic
demand for the surplus product, quite apart from the
puzzle where the money comes from. As Marx himself says in
another passage:</p>

<p>&#8216;The money on one side in that case calls forth expanded reproduction
on the other, because the possibility for it exists
without the money. For money in itself is not an element of
actual reproduction.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>And in a different context, Marx actually shows the question
about the &#8216;sources of money&#8217; to be a completely barren formulation
of the problem of accumulation.</p>

<p>In fact, he had come up against this difficulty once before
when examining the process of circulation. Still dealing with
simple reproduction, he had asked, in connection with the
circulation of the surplus value:</p>

<p>&#8216;But the commodity capital must be monetised before its
conversion into productive capital, or before the surplus-value
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
contained in it can be spent. Where does the money for this
purpose come from? This question seems difficult at the first
glance, and neither Tooke nor anyone else has answered it so
far.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>And he was then quite uncompromising about getting to
the root of the matter: &#8216;The circulating capital of 500 p.st.
advanced in the form of money-capital, whatever may be its
period of turn-over, may now stand for the total capital of
society, that is to say, of the capitalist class. Let the surplus-value
be 100 p.st. How can the entire capitalist class manage to
draw continually 600 p.st. out of the circulation, when they
continually throw only 500 p.st. into it?&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>All that, mind you, refers to simple reproduction, where the
entire surplus value is used for the personal consumption of the
capitalist class. The question should therefore from the outset
have been put more precisely in this form: how can the capitalists
secure for themselves consumer goods to the amount of
£100 surplus value on top of putting £500 into circulation for
constant and variable capital? It is immediately obvious that
those £500 which, in form of capital, always serve to buy means
of production and to pay the workers, cannot simultaneously
defray the expense of the capitalists&#8217; personal consumption.
Where, then, does the additional money come from?&mdash;the £100
the capitalists need to realise their own surplus value? Thus all
theoretical dodges one might devise for this point are summarily
disposed of by Marx right away:</p>

<p>&#8216;It should not be attempted to avoid this difficulty by
plausible subterfuges.</p>

<p>&#8216;For instance: So far as the constant circulating capital is
concerned, it is obvious that not all invest it simultaneously.
While the capitalist A sells his commodities so that his advanced
capital assumes the form of money, there is on the other hand,
the available money-capital of the buyer B which assumes the
form of his means of production which A is just producing. The
same transaction, which restores that of B to its productive
form, transforms it from money into materials of production and
labour-power; the same amount of money serves in the two-sided
process as in every simple purchase C-M. On the other
hand, when A reconverts his money into means of production,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
he buys from C, and this man pays B with it, etc., and thus the
transaction would be explained.</p>

<p>&#8216;But none of the laws referring to the quantity of the circulating
money, which have been analysed in the circulation of
commodities (vol. i, chap, iii), are in any way changed by the
capitalist character of the process of production.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hence, when we have said that the circulating capital of
society, to be advanced in the form of money, amounts to
500 p.st., we have already accounted for the fact that this is on
the one hand the sum simultaneously advanced, and that, on
the other hand, it sets in motion more productive capital than
500 p.st., because it serves alternately as the money fund of
different productive capitals. This mode of explanation, then,
assumes that money as existing whose existence it is called upon
to explain.</p>

<p>&#8216;It may be furthermore said: Capitalist A produces articles
which capitalist B consumes unproductively, individually. The
money of B therefore monetises the commodity-capital of A,
and thus the same amount serves for the monetisation of the
surplus-value of B and the circulating constant capital of A. But
in that case, the solution of the question to be solved is still more
directly assumed, the question: Whence does B get the money
for the payment of his revenue? How does he himself monetise
this surplus-portion of his product?</p>

<p>&#8216;It might also be answered that that portion of the circulating
variable capital, which A continually advances to his labourers,
flows back to him continually from the circulation, and only an
alternating part stays continually tied up for the payment of
wages. But a certain time elapses between the expenditure and
the reflux, and meanwhile the money paid out for wages might,
among other uses, serve for the monetisation of surplus-value.
But we know, in the first place, that, the greater the time, the
greater must be the supply of money which the capitalist A
must keep continually in reserve. In the second place, the
labourer spends the money, buys commodities for it, and thus
monetises to that extent the surplus-value contained in them.
Without penetrating any further into the question at this point,
it is sufficient to say that the consumption of the entire capitalist
class, and of the unproductive persons dependent upon it, keeps
step with that of the labouring class; so that, simultaneously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
with the money thrown into circulation by the labouring class,
the capitalists must throw money into it, in order to spend their
surplus-value as revenue. Hence money must be withdrawn
from circulation for it. This explanation would merely reduce
the quantity of money required, but not do away with it.</p>

<p>&#8216;Finally it might be said: A large amount of money is continually
thrown into circulation when fixed capital is first invested,
and it is not recovered from the circulation until after the lapse
of years, by him who threw it into circulation. May not this sum
suffice to monetise the surplus-value? The answer to this is that
the employment as fixed capital, if not by him who threw it into
circulation, then by some one else, is probably implied in the
sum of 500 p.st. (which includes the formation of a hoard for
needed reserve funds). Besides, it is already assumed in the
amount expended for the purchase of products serving as fixed
capital, that the surplus-value contained in them is also paid,
and the question is precisely, where the money for this purpose
came from.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>This parting shot, by the way, is particularly noteworthy in
that Marx here expressly repudiates the attempt to explain
realisation of the surplus value, even in the case of simple reproduction,
by means of a hoard formed for the periodical renewal
of fixed capital. Later on, with a view to realising the surplus
value under the much more difficult conditions of accumulation,
he makes more than one tentative effort to substantiate an
explanation of this type which he himself dismissed as a
&#8216;plausible subterfuge&#8217;.</p>

<p>Then follows a solution which has a somewhat disconcerting
ring: &#8216;The general reply has already been given: When a mass
of commodities valued at <i>x</i> times 1,000 p.st. has to circulate, it
changes absolutely nothing in the quantity of the money required
for this circulation, whether this mass of commodities
contains any surplus-value or not, and whether this mass of
commodities has been produced capitalistically or not. In other
words, <i>the problem itself does not exist</i>. All other conditions being
given, such as velocity of circulation of money, etc., a definite
sum of money is required in order to circulate the value of commodities
worth <i>x</i> times 1,000 p.st., quite independently of the
fact how much or how little of this value falls to the share of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
direct producers of these commodities. So far as any problem
exists here, it coincides with the general problem: Where does
all the money required for the circulation of the commodities
of a certain country come from?&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>The argument is quite sound. The answer to the general
question about the origin of the money for putting a certain
quantity of commodities into circulation within a country will
also tell us where the money for circulating the surplus value
comes from. The division of the bulk of value contained in these
commodities into constant and variable capital, and surplus
value, does not exist from the angle of the circulation of money&mdash;in
this connection, it is quite meaningless. But it is only from
the angle of the circulation of money, or of a simple commodity
circulation, that the problem has no existence. Under the aspect
of social reproduction as a whole, it is very real indeed; but it
should not, of course, be put in that misleading form that brings
us back to simple commodity circulation, where it has no meaning.
We should not ask, accordingly: Where does the money
required for realising the surplus value come from? but: Where
are the consumers for this surplus value? It is they, for sure, who
must have this money in hand in order to throw it into circulation.
Thus, Marx himself, although he just now denied the
problem to exist, keeps coming back to it time and again:</p>

<p>&#8216;Now, there are only two points of departure: The capitalist
and the labourer. All third classes of persons must either receive
money for their services from these two classes, or, to the extent
that they receive it without any equivalent services, they are
joint owners of the surplus-value in the form of rent, interest,
etc. The fact that the surplus-value does not all stay in the pocket
of the industrial capitalist, but must be shared by him with
other persons, has nothing to do with the present question. The
question is: How does he maintain his surplus-value, not, how
does he divide the money later after he has secured it? For the
present case, the capitalist may as well be regarded as the sole
owner of his surplus-value. As for the labourer it has already
been said that he is but the secondary point of departure, while
the capitalist is the primary starting point of the money thrown
by the labourer into circulation. The money first advanced as
variable capital is going through its second circulation, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the labourer spends it for the payment of means of subsistence.</p>

<p>&#8216;The capitalist class, then, remains the sole point of departure
of the circulation of money. If they need 400 p.st. for the payment
of means of production, and 100 p.st. for the payment of
labour-power, they throw 500 p.st. into circulation. But the
surplus-value incorporated in the product, with a rate of surplus-value
of 100 per cent, is equal to the value of 100 p.st. How can
they continually draw 600 p.st. out of circulation, when they
continually throw only 500 p.st. into it? From nothing comes
nothing. The capitalist class as a whole cannot draw out of
circulation what was not previously in it.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>Marx further explodes another device which might conceivably
be thought adequate to the problem, i.e. a more rapid
turnover of money enabling a larger amount of value to circulate
by means of a smaller amount of money. The dodge will not
work, of course, since the velocity of money in circulation is
already taken into account by equating the aggregate bulk of
commodities with a certain number of pounds sterling. But then
at last we seem in sight of a proper solution:</p>

<p>&#8216;Indeed, paradoxical as it may appear at first sight, it is the
capitalist class itself that throws the money into circulation
which serves for the realisation of the surplus-value incorporated
in the commodities. But, mark well, it is not thrown into circulation
as advanced money, not as capital. The capitalist class
spends it for their individual consumption. The money is not
advanced by them, although they are the point of departure of
its circulation.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>This lucid and comprehensive account is the best evidence
that the problem is not just imaginary but very real. It provides
a solution, not by disclosing a new &#8216;source of money&#8217; for the
realisation of the surplus value, but by pointing out at last the
consumers of this surplus value. We are still, on Marx&#8217;s assumption,
within the bounds of simple reproduction; the capitalist
class, that is to say, use the whole of their surplus value for
personal consumption. Since the capitalists are the consumers of
surplus value, it is not so much a paradox as a truism that they
must, in the nature of things, possess the money for appropriating
the objects of consumption, the natural form of this surplus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
value. The circulatory transaction of exchange is the necessary
consequence of the fact that the individual capitalist cannot
immediately consume his individual surplus value, and accordingly
the individual surplus product, as could, for instance, the
employer of slave labour. As a rule the natural material form of
the surplus product tends to preclude such use. The aggregate
surplus value of the capitalists in general is, however, contained
in the total social product&mdash;as long as there is simple reproduction&mdash;as
expressed by a corresponding quantity of consumer
goods for the capitalist class, just as the sum total of variable
capital has its corresponding equivalent in the quantity of consumer
goods for the working class, and as the constant capital
of all individual capitalists taken together is represented by
material means of production in an equivalent quantity. In
order to exchange the unconsumable individual surplus values
for a corresponding amount of consumer goods, a double transaction
of commodity exchange is needed: first, the sale of one&#8217;s
own surplus product and then the purchase of consumer goods
out of the surplus product of society. These two transactions can
only take place among members of the capitalist class, among
individual capitalists, which means that their agent, the money,
thereby merely changes hands as between one capitalist and
another without ever being alienated from the capitalist class in
general. Since simple reproduction inevitably implies the exchange
of equivalents, one and the same amount of money can
serve year by year for the circulation of the surplus value, and
only an excess of zeal will inspire the further query: where does
the money which mediates the capitalists&#8217; own consumption
come from in the first place? This, question, however, reduces to
a more general one: how did money capital initially come into
the hands of the capitalists, that money capital of which they
always retain a certain part for their personal consumption,
apart from what they use for productive investment? Put in this
way, however, the question belongs in the chapter of so-called
&#8216;primitive accumulation&#8217;, i.e. the historical genesis of capital,
going beyond the framework of an analysis of the process of
circulation as well as of reproduction.</p>

<p>Thus the fact is clear and unequivocal&mdash;so long as we remain
within the bounds of simple reproduction. Here the problem is
solved by the premises themselves; in fact, the solution is already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
anticipated by the very concept of simple reproduction which
indeed is based on the entire surplus value being consumed by
the capitalist class. This implies that it must also be the latter
who buy it, that is to say, individual capitalists must buy it from
each other.</p>

<p>&#8216;In the present case&#8217;, Marx says himself, &#8216;we had assumed,
that the sum of money which the capitalist throws into circulation
until the first surplus-value flows back to him, is exactly
equal to the surplus-value which he is going to produce and
monetise. This is obviously an arbitrary assumption, so far as,
the individual capitalist is concerned. But it must be correct
when applied to the entire capitalist class, when simple reproduction
is assumed. It expresses the same thing that this assumption
does, namely, that the entire surplus-value is consumed
unproductively, but it only, not any portion of the original
capital stock.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>But simple reproduction on a capitalist basis is after all an
imaginary quantity in economic theory: no more and no less
legitimate, and quite as unavoidable as &radic;&minus;1 in mathematics.
What is worse, it cannot offer any help at all with the problem
of realising the surplus value in real life, i.e. with regard to
enlarged reproduction or accumulation. Marx himself says so
for a second time in the further development of his analysis.</p>

<p>Where does the money for realising the surplus value come
from if there is accumulation, i.e. not consumption but capitalisation
of part of the surplus value? Marx&#8217;s first answer is as follows:</p>

<p>&#8216;In the first place, the additional money-capital required for
the function of the increasing productive capital is supplied by
that portion of the realised surplus-value which is thrown into
circulation by the capitalists as money-capital, not as the money
form of their revenue. The money is already present in the
hands of the capitalists. Only its employment is different.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>Our investigation of the reproductive process has already
made us familiar with this explanation, and we are equally
familiar with its defects; for one thing, the answer rests on the
moment of the first transition from simple reproduction to
accumulation. The capitalists only yesterday consumed their
entire surplus value, and thus had in hand an appropriate
amount of money for their circulation. To-day they decide to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
&#8216;save&#8217; part of the surplus value and to invest it productively
instead of squandering it. Provided that material means of
production were manufactured instead of luxury goods, they
need only put part of their personal money fund to a different
use. But the transition from simple reproduction to expanded
reproduction is no less a theoretical fiction than simple reproduction
of capital itself, for which reason Marx immediately
goes on to say:</p>

<p>&#8216;Now, by means of the additional productive capital, its product,
an additional quantity of commodities, is thrown into
circulation. Together with this additional quantity of commodities,
a portion of the additional money required for its
circulation is thrown into circulation, so far as the value of this
mass of commodities is equal to that of the productive capital
consumed in their production. This additional quantity of
money has precisely been advanced as an additional money-capital,
and therefore it flows back to the capitalist through the
turn-over of his capital. Here the same question reappears,
which we met previously. Where does the additional money
come from, by which the additional surplus-value now contained
in the form of commodities is to be realised?&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>The problem could not be put more precisely. But instead of
a solution, there follows the surprising conclusion:</p>

<p>&#8216;The general reply is again the same. The sum total of the
prices of the commodities has been increased, not because the
prices of a given quantity of commodities have risen, but because
the mass of the commodities now circulating is greater than that
of the previously circulating commodities, and because this
increase has not been offset by a fall in prices. The additional
money required for the circulation of this greater quantity of
commodities of greater value must be secured, either by greater
economy in the circulating quantity of money&mdash;whether by
means of balancing payments, etc., or by some measure which
accelerates the circulation of the same coins,&mdash;or by the transformation
of money from the form of a hoard into that of a
circulating medium.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>All this amounts to an exposition along these lines: under
conditions of developing and growing accumulation, capitalist
reproduction dumps ever larger masses of commodity values on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the market. To put this commodity mass of a continually
increasing value into circulation requires an ever larger amount
of money. This increasing amount of money must be found
somehow or other. All this is, no doubt, plausible and correct
as far as it goes, but our problem is not solved, it is merely
wished away.</p>

<p>One thing or the other! Either we regard the aggregate social
product in a capitalist economy simply as a mass, a conglomeration
of commodities of a certain value, seeing under
conditions of accumulation, a mere increase in this undifferentiated
mass of commodities and in the bulk of its value. Then all
we need say is that a corresponding quantity of money is required
for circulating this bulk of value, that with an increasing bulk
of value the quantity of money must also increase, unless this
growth of value is offset by acceleration of, and economy in,
the traffic. And the final question, where does all money originally
come from, could then be answered on Marx&#8217;s recipe: from
the gold mines. This, of course, is one way of looking at things,
that of simple commodity circulation. But in that case there is
no need to drag in concepts such as constant and variable
capital, or surplus value, which have no place in simple commodity
circulation, belonging essentially to the circulation of
capitals and to social reproduction; nor is there need to inquire
for sources of money for the realisation of the social surplus
value under conditions of first simple, and then enlarged, reproduction.
Under the aspect of simple commodity circulation
puzzles of this kind are without meaning or content. But once
these questions have been raised, once the course has been set
for an investigation into the circulation of capitals and social
reproduction, there can be no appealing to the sphere of simple
commodity circulation, where there is no such problem at all,
and consequently no solution to it. There can be no looking for
the answer there, and then saying triumphantly that the problem
has long been solved and in fact never really existed.</p>

<p>All this time, it appears, Marx has been tackling the problem
from a wrong approach. No intelligent purpose can be served by
asking for the source of the money needed to realise the surplus
value. The question is rather where the demand can arise&mdash;to
find an effective demand for the surplus value. If the problem
had been put in this way at the start, no such long-winded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
detours would have been needed to show whether it can be
solved or not. On the basis of simple reproduction, the matter
is easy enough: since all surplus value is consumed by the capitalists,
they themselves are the buyers and provide the full
demand for the social surplus value, and by the same token they
must also have the requisite cash in hand for circulation of the
surplus value. But in this showing it is quite evident that under
conditions of accumulation, i.e. of capitalisation of part of the
surplus value, it cannot, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, be the capitalists themselves
who buy the entire surplus value, that they cannot
possibly realise it. True, if the capitalised surplus value is to be
realised at all, money must be forthcoming in adequate quantities
for its realisation. But it is quite impossible that this money
should come from the purse of the capitalist class itself. Just
because accumulation is postulated, the capitalists cannot buy
their surplus value themselves, even though they might, <i>in
abstracto</i>, have the money to do so. But who else could provide
the demand for the commodities incorporating the capitalised
surplus value?</p>

<p>&#8216;Apart from this class (the capitalists), there is, according to
our assumption&mdash;the general and exclusive domination of capitalist
production&mdash;no other class but the working class. All that
the working class buys is equal to the sum total of its wages,
equal to the sum total of the variable capital advanced by the
entire capitalist class.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>The workers, then, are even less able than the capitalist class
to realise the capitalised surplus value. Somebody must buy it,
if the capitalists are still to be able to recover the capital they
have accumulated and advanced; and yet&mdash;we cannot think of
any buyers other than capitalists and workers. &#8216;How can the
entire capitalist class accumulate money under such circumstances?&#8217;<a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Realisation of the surplus value outside the only two existing
classes of society appears as indispensable as it looks impossible.
The accumulation of capital has been caught in a vicious circle.
At any rate, the second volume of <i>Capital</i> offers no way out.</p>

<p>If we should now ask why Marx&#8217;s <i>Capital</i> affords no solution
to this important problem of the accumulation of capital, we
must bear in mind above all that this second volume is not a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
finished whole but a manuscript that stops short half way
through.</p>

<p>The external form of its last chapters in particular proves
them to be in the nature of notes, intended to clear the author&#8217;s
own mind, rather than final conclusions ready for the reader&#8217;s
enlightenment. This fact is amply authenticated by the man
best in the position to know: Friedrich Engels, who edited the
second volume. In his introduction to the second volume he
reports in detail on the conditions of the preliminary studies and
the manuscripts Marx had left, which were to form the basis of
this volume:</p>

<p>&#8216;The mere enumeration of the manuscripts left by Marx as
a basis for Volume II proves the unparalleled conscientiousness
and strict self-criticism which he practised in his endeavour to
fully elaborate his great economic discoveries before he published
them. This self-criticism rarely permitted him to adapt his
presentation of the subject, in content as well as in form, to his
ever widening horizon, which he enlarged by incessant study.</p>

<p>&#8216;The material ... consists of the following parts: First, a
manuscript entitled &#8220;A contribution to the Critique of Political
Economy&#8221;, containing 1,472 quarto pages in 23 divisions,
written in the time from August, 1861, to June, 1863. It is a
continuation of the work of the same title, the first volume of
which appeared in Berlin, in 1859.... This manuscript, valuable
though it is, could not be used in the present edition of
Volume II.</p>

<p>&#8216;The manuscript next following in the order of time is that of
Volume III....</p>

<p>&#8216;The period after the publication of Volume I, which is next
in order, is represented by a collection of four manuscripts for
Volume II, marked I-IV by Marx himself. Manuscript I (150
pages) presumably written in 1865 or 1867, is the first independent,
but more or less fragmentary, elaboration of the
questions now contained in Volume II. This manuscript is likewise
unsuited for this edition. Manuscript III is partly a compilation
of quotations and references to the manuscripts containing
Marx&#8217;s extracts and comments, most of them relating to the
first section of Volume II, partly an elaboration of special points,
particularly a critique of Adam Smith&#8217;s statements as to fixed
and circulating capital and the source of profits; furthermore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
a discussion of the relations of the rate of surplus-value to the
rate of profit, which belongs in Volume III. The references
furnished little that was new, while the elaborations for Volumes
II and III were rendered valueless through subsequent revisions
and had to be ruled out for the greater part. Manuscript IV is
an elaboration, ready for printing, of the first section and the
first chapters of the second section of Volume II, and has been
used in its proper place. Although it was found that this manuscript
had been written earlier than Manuscript II, yet it was
far more finished in form and could be used with advantage for
the corresponding part of this volume. I had to add only a few
supplementary parts of Manuscript II. This last manuscript is
the only fairly completed elaboration of Volume II and dates
from the year 1870. The notes for the final revision, which I
shall mention immediately, say explicitly: &#8220;The second elaboration
must be used as a basis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8216;There is another interruption after 1870, due mainly to ill
health. Marx employed this time in his customary way, that is
to say he studied agronomics, agricultural conditions in America
and especially Russia, the money market and banking institutions,
and finally natural sciences, such as geology and physiology.
Independent mathematical studies also form a large part
of the numerous manuscripts of this period. In the beginning
of 1877, Marx had recovered sufficiently to resume once more
his chosen life&#8217;s work. The beginning of 1877 is marked by
references and notes from the above named four manuscripts
intended for a new elaboration of Volume II, the beginning of
which is represented by Manuscript V (56 pages in folio). It
comprises the first four chapters and is not very fully worked
out. Essential points are treated in footnotes. The material is
rather collected than sifted, but it is the last complete presentation
of this most important first section. A preliminary attempt
to prepare this part for the printer was made in Manuscript VI
(after October, 1877, and before July, 1878), embracing 17
quarto pages, the greater part of the first chapter. A second and
last attempt was made in Manuscript VII, dated July 2, 1878,
and consisting of 7 pages in folio.</p>

<p>&#8216;About this time Marx seems to have realised that he would
never be able to complete the second and third volume in a
manner satisfactory to himself, unless a complete revolution in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
his health took place. Manuscripts V-VIII show traces of hard
struggles against depressing physical conditions far too frequently
to be ignored. The most difficult part of the first section
had been worked over in Manuscript V. The remainder of the
first, and the entire second section, with the exception of
Chapter 17, presented no great theoretical difficulties. But the
third section, dealing with the reproduction and circulation of
social capital, seemed to be very much in need of revision.
Manuscript II, it must be pointed out, had first treated of this
reproduction without regard to the circulation which is instrumental
in effecting it, and then taken up the same question with
regard to circulation. It was the intention of Marx to eliminate
this section and to reconstruct it in such a way that it would
conform to his wider grasp of the subject. This gave rise to
Manuscript VIII, containing only 70 pages in quarto. A comparison
with Section III, as printed after deducting the paragraphs
inserted out of Manuscript II, shows the amount of
matter compressed by Marx into this space.</p>

<p>&#8216;Manuscript VIII is likewise merely a preliminary presentation
of the subject, and its main object was to ascertain and
develop the new points of view not set forth in Manuscript II,
while those points were ignored about which there was nothing
new to say. An essential part of Chapter 17, Section II, which is
more or less relevant to Section III, was at the same time drawn
into this discussion and expanded. The logical sequence was
frequently interrupted, the treatment of the subject was incomplete
in various places, and especially the conclusion was very
fragmentary. But Marx expressed as nearly as possible what he
intended to say on the subject.</p>

<p>&#8216;This is the material for Volume II, out of which I was
supposed &#8220;to make something&#8221;, as Marx said to his daughter
Eleanor shortly before his death.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>We cannot but admire this &#8216;something&#8217; which Engels managed
to &#8216;make&#8217; from material of such a kind. As far as our present
problem is concerned, however, this detailed report makes
it clear that no more than the first two of the three sections that
make up volume ii were anything like ready for print in the
manuscripts Marx left: the section &#8216;On the Circulation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Money and Commodity Capital&#8217; and on &#8216;The Causes of Circulation
and the Turnover of Capital&#8217;. The third section which
treats of the reproduction of total capital is merely a collection
of fragments which Marx himself considered to be &#8216;very much
in need of revision.&#8217; Yet it is the last part of this section, i.e.
chapter 21, &#8216;On Accumulation and Enlarged Reproduction&#8217;,
which is of primary importance in the present context, and of
the whole book this is the most incomplete. It comprises thirty-five
pages of print in all and breaks off right in the middle of
the analysis.</p>

<p>Besides this extraneous circumstance, we would suggest
another point of great influence. Marx&#8217;s investigation of the
social reproductive process starts off, as we have seen, from the
analysis of Adam Smith which came to grief, among other
reasons, because of the erroneous doctrine that the price of all
commodities is composed of <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>. Polemics against this dogma
dominated Marx&#8217;s entire analysis of the reproductive process.
He devoted all his attention to proving that the total capital of
society must serve, not only for consumption to the full amount
of the various sources of revenue, but also for renewal of the
constant capital. And inasmuch as the purest theoretical form
for this line of reasoning is given, not by enlarged reproduction,
but by simple reproduction, Marx tends to consider reproduction
mainly from a point of view that is the very opposite of
accumulation, from the assumption that the entire surplus value
is consumed by the capitalists. How greatly these polemics influenced
his analysis is proved by his returning time and again
in the course of his work to the attack on Adam Smith from the
most various angles. So already in volume i, the following pages
are devoted to it: vol. i, sect. 7, chap. 24, (2), pp. 588-602, and
in vol. ii, pp. 417-56, p. 473, pp. 504-8, and pp. 554 f.</p>

<p>Marx again takes up the question of total reproduction in
volume iii but from the start becomes once more involved with
the problem set by Smith to which he devotes the whole of his
49th chapter and most of chapter 50 (pp. 968-92 and 992-1022).
Finally, in <i>Theorien ueber den Mehrwert</i>, we again find
detailed polemics against Smith&#8217;s dogma: pp. 164-253 in vol. i,
and pp. 92, 95, 126, 233, and 262 in vol. ii, part 2. Marx
repeatedly stressed and emphasised the fact that he considered
replacement of the constant capital from the aggregate social
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
product the most difficult and important problem of reproduction.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
The other problem, that of accumulation, i.e. realisation
of the surplus value for the purpose of capitalisation, was thus
pushed into the background, so that in the end Marx hardly
touched upon it.</p>

<p>This problem being of such paramount importance for capitalist
economy, it is not surprising that bourgeois economists
have dealt with it again and again. Attempts to grapple with
this vital question for capitalist economy, with the question
whether capital accumulation is possible in practice, come up
time and again in the history of economic theory. To these
historical attempts, before and after Marx, at solving this problem
we shall now turn.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER X</i></h2>

<h2>SISMONDI&#8217;S THEORY
OF REPRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The first grave doubts as to the divine character of the
capitalist order came to bourgeois economists under the
immediate impact of the first crises of 1815 and 1818-19
in England. Even then it had still been external circumstances
which led up to these crises, and they appeared to be ephemeral.
Napoleon&#8217;s blockade of the Continent which for a time had cut
off England from her European markets and had favoured a
considerable development of home industries in some of the
continental countries, was partly responsible; for the rest the
material exhaustion of the Continent, owing to the long period
of war, made for a smaller demand for English products than
had been expected when the blockade was lifted. Still, these
early crises were enough to reveal to the contemporary world
the sinister aspects of this best of all social orders. Glutted
markets, shops filled with goods nobody could buy, frequent
bankruptcies&mdash;and on the other hand the glaring poverty of
the toiling masses&mdash;for the first time all this starkly met the eyes
of theorists who had preached the gospel of the beautiful
harmonies of bourgeois <i>laissez-faire</i> and had sung its praises
in all keys. All contemporary trade reports, periodicals and
travellers&#8217; notes told of the losses sustained by English merchants.
In Italy, Germany, Russia, and Brazil, the English disposed
of their commodity stocks at a loss of anything between
25 per cent and <span class="fraction" title="33 and 1 third">33<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></span> per cent. People at the Cape of Good Hope
in 1818 complained that all the shops were flooded with
European goods offered at lower prices than in Europe and still
unmarketable. From Calcutta there came similar complaints.
From New Holland whole cargoes returned to England. In the
United States, a contemporary traveller reports, &#8216;there was no
town nor hamlet from one end to the other of this immense
and prosperous continent where the amount of commodities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
displayed for sale did not considerably exceed the means of the
purchasers, although the vendors tried to attract custom by
long-term credits, all sorts of facilities for payment, payment by
instalments and acceptance of payment in kind&#8217;.</p>

<p>At the same time, England was hearing the desperate outcry
of her workers. The <i>Edinburgh Review</i> of 1820<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>  quotes an address
by the Nottingham frame-work knitters which contained the
following statements:</p>

<p>&#8216;After working from 14 to 16 hours a day, we only earn from
4<i>s.</i> to 7<i>s.</i> a week, to maintain our wives and families upon; and
we farther state, that although we have substituted bread and
water, or potatoes and salt, for that more wholesome food an
Englishman&#8217;s table used to abound with, we have repeatedly
retired, after a heavy day&#8217;s labour, and have been under the
necessity of putting our children supperless to bed, to stifle the
cries of hunger. We can most solemnly declare, that for the last
eighteen months we have scarcely known what it was to be free
from the pangs of hunger.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Then Owen in England, and Sismondi in France, almost
simultaneously raised their voices in a weighty indictment of
capitalist society. Owen, as a hard-headed Englishman and
citizen of the leading industrial state, constituted himself spokesman
for a generous social reform, whereas the petty-bourgeois
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Swiss rather lost himself in sweeping denunciations of the imperfections
of the existing social order and of classical economics.
And yet, by so doing, Sismondi gave bourgeois economics a
much harder nut to crack than Owen, whose fertile practical
activities were directly applied to the proletariat.</p>

<p>Sismondi explained in some detail that the impetus for his
social criticism came from England, and especially her first
crisis. In the second edition of his <i>Nouveaux Principes d&#8217;Économie
Politique Ou De La Richesse Dans Ses Rapports Avec La Population</i>,<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
eight years after the publication of the first edition in 1819, he
writes as follows:</p>

<p>&#8216;It was in England that I performed the task of preparing the
new edition. England has given birth to the most celebrated
Political Economists: the science is cultivated even at this time
with increased ardour.... Universal competition or the effort
always to produce more and always cheaper, has long been
the system in England, a system which I have attacked as
dangerous. This system has used production by manufacture to
advance with gigantic steps, but it has from time to time precipitated
the manufacturers into frightful distress. It was in presence
of these convulsions of wealth that I thought I ought to
place myself, to review my reasonings and compare them with
facts.&mdash;The study of England has confirmed me in my &#8220;New
Principles&#8221;. In this astonishing country, which seems to be
subject to a great experiment for the instruction of the rest of the
world, I have seen production increasing, whilst enjoyments
were diminishing. The mass of the nation here, no less than
philosophers, seems to forget that the increase of wealth is not
the end in political economy, but its instrument in procuring
the happiness of all. I sought for this happiness in every class,
and I could nowhere find it. The high English aristocracy has
indeed arrived to a degree of wealth and luxury which surpasses
all that can be seen in other nations; nevertheless it does not
itself enjoy the opulence which it seems to have acquired at the
expense of the other classes; security is wanting and in every
family most of the individuals experience privation rather than
abundance.... Below this titled and not titled aristocracy, I
see commerce occupy a distinguished rank; its enterprises embrace
the whole world, its agents brave the ices of the poles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
and the heats of the equator, whilst every one of its leading men,
meeting on Exchange, can dispose of thousands. At the same
time, in the streets of London, and in those of the other great
towns of England, the shops display goods sufficient for the consumption
of the world.&mdash;But have riches secured to the English
merchant the kind of happiness which they ought to secure
him? No: in no country are failures so frequent, nowhere are
those colossal fortunes, sufficient in themselves to supply a public
loan to uphold an Empire, or a republic, overthrown with as
much rapidity. All complain that business is scarce, difficult,
not remunerative. Twice, within an interval of a few years, a
terrible crisis has ruined part of the bankers, and spread desolation
among all the English manufacturers. At the same time
another crisis has ruined the farmers, and been felt in its rebound
by retail dealers. On the other hand, commerce, in spite
of its immense extent, has ceased to call for young men who have
their fortunes to make; every place is occupied, in the superior
ranks of society no less than in the inferior; the greater number
offer their labour in vain, without being able to obtain remuneration.&mdash;Has,
then, this national opulence, whose material
progress strikes every eye, nevertheless tended to the advantage
of the poor? Not so. The people of England are destitute of
comfort now, and of security for the future. There are no longer
yeomen, they have been obliged to become day labourers. In
the towns there are scarcely any longer artisans, or independent
heads of a small business, but only manufacturers. The operative,
to employ a word which the system has created, does not
know what it is to have a station; he only gains wages, and as
these wages cannot suffice for all seasons, he is almost every year
reduced to ask alms from the poor-rates.&mdash;This opulent nation
has found it more economical to sell all the gold and silver
which she possessed, to do without coin, and to depend entirely
on a paper circulation; she has thus voluntarily deprived herself
of the most valuable of all the advantages of coin: stability of
value. The holders of the notes of the provincial banks run the
risk every day of being ruined by frequent and, as it were,
epidemic failures of the bankers; and the whole state is exposed
to a convulsion in the fortune of every individual, if an invasion
or a revolution should shake the credit of the national bank.
The English nation has found it more economical to give up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
those modes of cultivation which require much hand-labour,
and she has dismissed half the cultivators who lived in the
fields. She has found it more economical to supersede workmen
by steam-engines; she has dismissed ... the operatives in towns,
and weavers giving place to power-looms, are now sinking
under famine; she has found it more economical to reduce all
working people to the lowest possible wages on which they can
subsist, and these working people being no longer anything but
a rabble, have not feared plunging into still deeper misery by
the addition of an increasing family. She has found it more
economical to feed the Irish with potatoes, and clothe them in
rags; and now every packet brings legions of Irish, who, working
for less than the English, drive them from every employment.
What is the fruit of this immense accumulation of wealth? Have
they had any other effect than to make every class partake of
care, privation and the danger of complete ruin? Has not England,
by forgetting men for things, sacrificed the end to the
means?&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>This mirror, held up to capitalist society almost a century
before the time of writing, is clear and comprehensive enough in
all conscience. Sismondi put his finger on every one of the sore
spots of bourgeois economics: the ruin of small enterprise; the
drift from the country; the proletarisation of the middle classes;
the impoverishment of the workers; the displacement of the
worker by the machine; unemployment; the dangers of the
credit system; social antagonisms; the insecurity of existence;
crises and anarchy. His harsh, emphatic scepticism struck a
specially shrill discord with the complacent optimism, the idle
worship of harmony as preached by vulgar economics which, in
the person of MacCulloch in England and of Say in France, was
becoming the fashion in both countries. It is easy to imagine
what a deep and painful impression remarks like the following
were bound to make:</p>

<p>&#8216;There can only be luxury if it is bought with another&#8217;s
labour; only those will work hard and untiringly who have to
do so in order to get not the frills but the very necessities of life.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>&#8216;Although the invention of the machine which increases man&#8217;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
capacity, is a blessing for mankind, it is made into a scourge for
the poor by the unjust distribution we make of its benefits.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>&#8216;The gain of an employer of labour is sometimes nothing if not
despoiling the worker he employs; he does not benefit because
his enterprise produces much more than it costs, but because he
does not pay all the costs, because he does not accord the
labourer a remuneration equal to his work. Such an industry is
a social evil, for it reduces those who perform the work to utmost
poverty, assuring to those who direct it but the ordinary profits
on capital.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>&#8216;Amongst those who share in the national income, one group
acquires new rights each year by new labours, the other have
previously acquired permanent rights by reason of a primary
effort which makes a year&#8217;s labour more advantageous.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>&#8216;Nothing can prevent that every new discovery in applied
mechanics should diminish the working population by that
much. To this danger it is constantly exposed, and society provides
no remedy for it.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>&#8216;A time will come, no doubt, when our descendants will condemn
us as barbarians because we have left the working classes
without security, just as we already condemn, as they also will,
as barbarian the nations who reduced those same classes to
slavery.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Sismondi&#8217;s criticism thus goes right to the root of the matter;
for him there can be no compromise or evasion which might try
to gloss over the dark aspects of capitalist enrichment he exposed,
as merely temporary shortcomings of a transition period.
He concludes his investigation with the following rejoinder to
Say:</p>

<p>&#8216;For seven years I have indicated this malady of the social
organism, and for seven years it has continuously increased. I
cannot regard such prolonged suffering as the mere frictions
which always accompany a change. Going back to the origin of
income, I believe to have shown the ills we experience to be the
consequence of a flaw in our organisation, to have shown that
they are not likely to come to an end.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>The disproportion between capitalist production and the distribution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
of incomes determined by the former appears to him
the source of all evil. This is the point from which he comes to
the problem of accumulation with which we are now concerned.</p>

<p>The main thread of his criticism against classical economics is
this: capitalist production is encouraged to expand indefinitely
without any regard to consumption; consumption, however, is
determined by income.</p>

<p>&#8216;All the modern economists, in fact, have allowed that the
fortune of the public, being only the aggregation of private
fortunes, has its origin, is augmented, distributed and destroyed
by the same means as the fortune of each individual. They all
know perfectly well, that in a private fortune, the most important
fact to consider is the income, and that by the income must
be regulated consumption or expenditure, or the capital will be
destroyed. But as, in the fortune of the public, the capital of one
becomes the income of another, they have been perplexed to
decide what was capital, and what income, and they have
therefore found it more simple to leave the latter entirely out of
their calculations. By neglecting a quality so essential to be
determined, Say and Ricardo have arrived at the conclusion,
that consumption is an unlimited power, or at least having no
limits but those of production, whilst it is in fact limited by
income.... They announced that whatever abundance might
be produced, it would always find consumers, and they have
encouraged the producers to cause that glut in the markets,
which at this time occasions the distress of the civilised world;
whereas they should have forewarned the producers that they
could only reckon on those consumers who possessed income.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Sismondi thus grounds his views in a theory of income. What
is income, and what is capital? He pays the greatest attention to
this distinction which he calls &#8216;the most abstract and difficult
question of political economics&#8217;. The fourth chapter of his
second book is devoted to this problem. As usual, Sismondi
starts his investigation with Robinson Crusoe. For such a one,
the distinction between capital and income was still &#8216;confused&#8217;;
it becomes &#8216;essential&#8217; only in society. Yet in society, too, this
distinction is very difficult, largely on account of the already
familiar myth of bourgeois economics, according to which &#8216;the
capital of one becomes the income of another&#8217;, and <i>vice versa</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Adam Smith was responsible for this confusion which was then
elevated to an axiom by Say in justification of mental inertia
and superficiality. It was loyally accepted by Sismondi.</p>

<p>&#8216;The nature of capital and of income are always confused by
the mind; we see that what is income for one becomes capital
for another, and the same object, in passing from hand to hand,
successively acquires different denominations; the value which
becomes detached from an object that has been consumed,
appears as a metaphysical quantity which one expends and the
other exchanges, which for one perishes together with the object
itself and which for the other renews itself and lasts for the time
of circulation.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>After this promising introduction, Sismondi dives right into
the difficult problem and declares: all wealth is a product of
labour; income is part of wealth, and must therefore have the
same origin. However, it is &#8216;customary&#8217; to recognise three kinds
of income, called rent, profit and wage respectively, which
spring from the three sources of &#8216;land, accumulated capital and
labour&#8217;. As to the first thesis, he is obviously on the wrong tack.
As the wealth of a society, i.e. as the aggregate of useful objects,
of use-values, wealth is not merely a product of labour but also
of nature who both supplies raw materials and provides the
means to support human labour. Income, on the other hand, is
a concept of value. It indicates the amount to which an individual
or individuals can dispose over part of the wealth of society
or of the aggregate social product. In view of Sismondi&#8217;s insistence
that social income is part of social wealth, we might
assume him to understand by social income the actual annual
fund for consumption. The remaining part of wealth that has
not been consumed, then, is the capital of society. Thus we
obtain at least a vague outline of the required distinction between
capital and income on a social basis. At the very next
moment, however, Sismondi accepts the &#8216;customary&#8217; distinction
between three kinds of income, only one of which derives
exclusively from &#8216;accumulated capital&#8217; while in the other two
&#8216;land&#8217; or &#8216;labour&#8217; are conjoined with capital. The concept of
capital thus at once becomes hazy again. However, let us see
what Sismondi has to say about the origin of these three kinds
of income which betray a rift in the foundations of society. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
is right to take a certain development of labour productivity
as his point of departure.</p>

<p>&#8216;By reason of the advances both in industry and science, by
which man has subjugated the forces of nature, every worker
can produce more, far more, in a day than he needs to
consume.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>Sismondi thus rightly stresses the fact that the productivity
of labour is an indispensable condition for the historical foundation
of exploitation. Yet he goes on to explain the actual origin
of exploitation in a way typical of bourgeois economics: &#8216;But
even though his labour produces wealth, this wealth, if he is
called upon to enjoy it, will make him less and less fit for work.
Besides, wealth hardly ever remains in the possession of the man
who must live by the work of his hands.&#8217;<a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>Thus he makes exploitation and class antagonism the necessary
spur to production, quite in accord with the followers of
Ricardo and Malthus. But now he comes to the real cause
of exploitation, the divorce of labour power from the means of
production.</p>

<p>&#8216;The worker cannot, as a rule, keep the land as his own; land,
however, has a productive capacity which human labour but
directs to the uses of man. The master of the land on which
labour is performed, reserves a share in the fruits of labour to
which his land has contributed, as his remuneration for the
benefits afforded by this productive capacity.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>This is called rent. And further: &#8216;In our state of civilisation,
the worker can no longer call his own an adequate fund of
objects for his consumption, enough to live while he performs
the labours he has undertaken&mdash;until he has found a buyer.
He no longer owns the raw materials, often coming from far
away, on which he must exercise his industry. Even less does he
possess that complicated and costly machinery which facilitates
his work and makes it infinitely more productive. The rich man
who possesses his consumption goods, his raw materials and his
machines, need not work himself, for by supplying the worker
with all these, he becomes in a sense the master of his work. As
reward for the advantages he has put at the worker&#8217;s disposal,
he takes outright the greater part of the fruits of his labour.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>This is called capital profits. What remains of wealth, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
the cream has been taken off twice, by landlord and capitalist,
is the wage of labour, the income of the worker. And Sismondi
adds: &#8216;He can consume it without reproduction.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>Thus, Sismondi makes the fact of non-reproduction the
criterion of income as distinct from capital for wages as well as
for rent. In this, however, he is only right with regard to rent
and the consumed part of capital profits; as for the part of the
social product which is consumed in form of wages, it certainly
does reproduce itself; it becomes the labour power of the wage
labourer, for him a commodity by whose sale he lives, which he
can bring to market again and again; for society it becomes the
material form of variable capital which must reappear time and
again in the aggregate reproduction of a year, if there is to be
no loss.</p>

<p>So far so good. Hitherto we have only learned two facts: the
productivity of labour permits of the exploitation of the workers
by those who do not work themselves, and exploitation becomes
the actual foundation of the distribution of income owing to the
divorce of the worker from his means of production. But we
still do not know what is capital and what income, and Sismondi
proceeds to clarify this point, starting as usual with
Robinson Crusoe:</p>

<p>&#8216;In the eyes of the individual all wealth was nothing but a
provision prepared beforehand for the time of need. Even so,
he already distinguished two elements in this provision ... one
part which he budgets to have at hand for immediate or almost
immediate use, and the other which he will not need until it is
to afford him new production. Thus one part of his corn must
feed him until the next harvest, another part, reserved for sowing,
is to bear fruit the following year. The formation of society
and the introduction of exchange, permit to increase this seed,
this fertile part of accumulated wealth, almost indefinitely, and
this is what is called capital.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Balderdash would be a better name for all this. In using the
analogy of seed, Sismondi here identifies means of production
and capital, and this is wrong for two reasons. First, means of
production are capital not intrinsically, but only under quite
definite historical conditions; secondly, the concept of capital
covers more than just the means of production. In capitalist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
society&mdash;with all the conditions Sismondi ignores&mdash;the means of
production are only a part of capital, i.e. they are constant
capital.</p>

<p>Sismondi here lost his thread plainly because he tried to
establish a connection between the capital concept and the
material aspects of social reproduction. Earlier, so long as he
was concerned with the individual capitalist, he listed means of
subsistence for the workers together with means of production
as component parts of capital&mdash;again a mistake in view of the
material aspects of the reproduction of individual capitals. Yet
as soon as he tries to focus the material foundations of social
reproduction and sets out to make the correct distinction between
consumer goods and means of production, the concept of
capital dissolves in his hands.</p>

<p>However, Sismondi well knows that the means of production
are not the sole requisites for production and exploitation;
indeed, he has the proper instinct that the core of the relation of
exploitation is the very fact of exchange with living labour.
Having just reduced capital to constant capital, he now immediately
reduces it exclusively to variable capital:</p>

<p>&#8216;When the farmer has put in reserve all the corn he expects
to need till the next harvest, he will find a good use for the
surplus corn: he will feed what he has left over to other people
who are going to work for him, till his land, spin and weave
his hemp and wool, etc.... By this procedure, the farmer converts
a part of his income into capital, and in fact, this is the
way in which new capital is always formed.... The corn he
has reaped over and above what he must eat while he is working,
and over and above what he will have to sow in order to
maintain the same level of exploitation, is wealth which he can
give away, squander and consume in idleness without becoming
any poorer; it was income, but as soon as he uses it to feed
producers, as soon as he exchanges it for labour, or for the fruits
to come from the work of his labourers, his weavers, his miners,
it is a permanent value that multiplies and will no longer
perish; it is capital.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>Here there is some grain mixed up with quite a lot of chaff.
Constant capital seems still required to maintain production on
the old scale, although it is strangely reduced to circulating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
capital, and although the reproduction of fixed capital is completely
ignored. Circulating capital apparently is also superfluous
for the expansion of reproduction, for accumulation: the
whole capitalised part of the surplus value is converted into
wages for new workers who evidently labour in mid-air, without
material means of production. The same view is expressed even
more clearly elsewhere:</p>

<p>&#8216;When the rich man cuts down his income in order to add to
his capital, he is thus conferring a benefit on the poor, because
he himself shares out the annual product; and whatever he calls
income, he will keep for his own consumption; whatever he calls
capital, he gives to the poor man to constitute an income for
him.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>Yet at the same time Sismondi gives due weight to the &#8216;secret
of profit-making&#8217; and the origin of capital. Surplus value arises
from the exchange of capital for labour, from variable capital,
and capital arises from the accumulation of surplus value.</p>

<p>With all this, however, we have not made much progress
towards a distinction between capital and income. Sismondi
now attempts to represent the various elements of production
and income in terms of the appropriate parts of the aggregate
social product.</p>

<p>&#8216;The employer of labour, as also the labourer, does not use
all his productive wealth for the sowing; he devotes part of it to
buildings, mills and tools which render the work easier and
more productive, just as a share of the labourer&#8217;s wealth had
been devoted to the permanent work of making the soil more
fertile. Thus we see how the different kinds of wealth successively
come into being and become distinct. One part of the
wealth accumulated by society is devoted by every one who
possesses it to render labour more profitable by slow consumption,
and make the blind forces of nature execute the work
of man; this part is called <i>fixed capital</i> and comprises reclaiming,
irrigation, factories, the tools of trade, and mechanical contrivances
of every description. A second part of wealth is destined
for immediate consumption, to reproduce itself in the work it
gets done, to change its form, though not its value, without
cease. This part is called <i>circulating capital</i> and it comprises seed,
raw materials for manufacture, and wages. Finally, a third part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
of wealth becomes distinguishable from the second: it is the
value by which the finished job exceeds the advances which had
to be made: this part is called <i>income</i> on capitals and is destined
to be consumed without reproduction.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>After this laborious attempt to achieve a division of the aggregate
social production according to incommensurable categories,
fixed capital, circulating capital, and surplus value,
Sismondi soon shows unmistakable signs that he means constant
capital when he speaks of fixed capital, and variable capital
when he speaks of circulating capital. For &#8216;all that is created&#8217;, is
destined for human consumption, though fixed capital is consumed
&#8216;mediately&#8217; while the circulating capital &#8216;passes into the
consumption fund of the worker whose wage it forms&#8217;.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>  Thus
we are a little nearer to the division of the social product into
constant capital (means of production), variable capital (provisions
for the workers) and surplus value (provisions for the
capitalists). But so far Sismondi&#8217;s explanations are not particularly
illuminating on the subject which he himself describes as
&#8216;fundamental&#8217;. In this welter of confusion, at any rate, we
cannot see any progress beyond Adam Smith&#8217;s &#8216;massive
thought&#8217;.</p>

<p>Sismondi feels this himself and would clarify the problem &#8216;by
the simplest of all methods&#8217;, sighing that &#8216;this movement of
wealth is so abstract and requires such great power of concentration
to grasp it properly&#8217;.<a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Thus again we put on blinkers with
a focus on Robinson [Crusoe], who in the meantime has
changed to the extent that he has produced a family and is now
a pioneer of colonial policy:</p>

<p>&#8216;A solitary farmer in a distant colony on the border of the
desert has reaped 100 sacks of corn this year; there is no market
where to bring them; this corn, in any case, must be consumed
within the year, else it will be of no value to the farmer; yet the
farmer and his family eat only 30 sacks of it; this will be his
expenditure, constituting the exchange of his income; it is not
reproduced for anybody whatever. Then he will call for workers,
he will make them clear woods, and drain swamps in his neighbourhood
and put part of the desert under the plough. These
workers will eat another 30 sacks of corn: this will be their
expenditure; they will be in a position to afford this expenditure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
at the price of their revenue, that is to say their labour; for the
farmer it will be an exchange: he will have converted his 30
sacks into fixed capital. In the end, he is left with 40 sacks. He
will sow them that year, instead of the 20 he had sown the previous
year; this constitutes his circulating capital which he will
have doubled. Thus the 100 sacks will have been consumed, but
of these 100 sacks 70 are a real investment for him, which will
reappear with great increase, some of them at the very next
harvest, and the others in all subsequent harvests.&mdash;The very
isolation of the farmer we have just assumed gives us a better
feeling for the limitations of such an operation. If he has only
found consumers for 60 of the 100 sacks harvested in that year,
who is going to eat the 200 sacks produced the following year
by the increase in his sowing? His family, you might say, which
will increase. No doubt; but human generations do not multiply
as quickly as subsistence. If our farmer had hands available to
repeat this assumed process each year, his corn harvest will be
doubled every year, and his family could at the most be doubled
once in 25 years.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>Though the example is naïve, the vital question stands out
clearly in the end: where are the buyers for the surplus value
that has been capitalised? The accumulation of capital can indefinitely
increase the production of the society. But what about
the consumption of society? This is determined by the various
kinds of income. Sismondi explains this important subject in
chapter v of book ii, &#8216;The Distribution of the National Income
Among the Various Classes of Citizens&#8217;, in a resumed effort to
describe the components of the social product.</p>

<p>&#8216;Under this aspect, the national income is composed of two
parts and no more; the one consists in annual production ...
the profit arising from wealth. The second is the capacity for
work which springs from life. This time we understand by
wealth both territorial possessions and capital, and by profit the
net income accruing to the owners as well as the profit of the
capitalist.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Thus all the means of production are separated from the
national income as &#8216;wealth&#8217;, and this income is divided into
surplus value and labour power, or better, its equivalent, the
variable capital. This, then, though still far too vague, is our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
division into constant capital, variable capital and surplus
value. But &#8216;national income&#8217;, it soon transpires, means for
Sismondi the annual aggregate product of society:</p>

<p>&#8216;Similarly, annual production, or the result of all the nation&#8217;s
work in the course of a year, is composed of two parts: one we
have just discussed&mdash;the profit resulting from wealth; the other
is the capacity for work, which is assumed to equal the part of
wealth for which it is exchanged, or the subsistence of the
workers.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>The aggregate social product is thus resolved, in terms of
value, into two parts: variable capital and surplus value&mdash;constant
capital has disappeared. We have arrived at Smith&#8217;s
dogma that the commodity price is resolved into <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> (or is
composed of <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>)&mdash;in other words, the aggregate product
consists solely of consumer goods for workers and capitalists.</p>

<p>Sismondi then goes on to the problem of realising the aggregate
product. On the one hand, the sum total of incomes in a
society consists of wages, capital profits and rents, and is thus
represented by <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>; on the other hand, the aggregate social
product, in terms of value, is equally resolved into <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> &#8216;so that
national income and annual production balance each other
(and appear as equal quantities)&#8217;, i.e. so that they must be
equal in value.</p>

<p>&#8216;Annual production is consumed altogether during the year,
but in part by the workers who, by exchanging their labour for
it, convert it into capital and reproduce it; in part by the
capitalists who, exchanging their income for it, annihilate it.
The whole of the annual income is destined to be exchanged for
the whole of annual production.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>This is the basis on which, in the sixth chapter of book ii,
&#8216;On Reciprocal Determination of Production and Consumption&#8217;,
Sismondi finally sets up the following precise law of reproduction:
&#8216;It is the income of the past year which must pay for
the production of the present year.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>If this is true, how can there be any accumulation of capital?
If the aggregate product must be completely consumed by the
workers and capitalists, we obviously remain within the bounds
of simple reproduction, and there can be no solution to the
problem of accumulation. Sismondi&#8217;s theory in fact amounts to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
a denial of the possibility of accumulation. The aggregate social
demand being the bulk of wages given to the workers and the
previous consumption of the capitalists, who will be left to buy
the surplus product if reproduction expands? On this count,
Sismondi argues that accumulation is objectively impossible, as
follows:</p>

<p>&#8216;What happens after all is always that we exchange the whole
of production for the whole production of the previous year.
Besides, if production gradually increases, the exchange, at the
same time as it improves future conditions, must entail a small
loss every year.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>In other words, when the aggregate product is realised,
accumulation is bound each year to create a surplus that cannot
be sold. Sismondi, however, is afraid of drawing this final conclusion,
and prefers a &#8216;middle course&#8217;, necessitating a somewhat
obscure subterfuge: &#8216;If this loss is not heavy, and evenly distributed,
everyone will bear with it without complaining about
his income. This is what constitutes the national economy, and
the series of such small sacrifices increases capital and common
wealth.&#8217;<a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>If, on the other hand, there is ruthless accumulation, this
surplus residue becomes a public calamity, and the result is a
crisis. Thus a petty-bourgeois subterfuge becomes the solution of
Sismondi: putting the dampers on accumulation. He constantly
polemises against the classical school which advocates unrestricted
development of the productive forces and expansion
of production; and his whole work is a warning against
the fatal consequences of giving full rein to the desire to
accumulate.</p>

<p>Sismondi&#8217;s exposition proves that he was unable to grasp the
reproductive process as a whole. Quite apart from his unsuccessful
attempt to distinguish between the categories of capital and
income from the point of view of society, his theory of reproduction
suffers from the fundamental error he took over from Adam
Smith: the idea that personal consumption absorbs the entire
annual product, without leaving any part of the value for the
renewal of society&#8217;s constant capital, and also, that accumulation
consists merely of the transformation of capitalised surplus
value into variable capital. Yet, if later critics of Sismondi, e.g.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the Russian Marxist Ilyin,<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>  think that pointing out this fundamental
error in the analysis of the aggregate product can justify
a cavalier dismissal of Sismondi&#8217;s entire theory of accumulation
as inadequate, as &#8216;nonsense&#8217;, they merely demonstrate their own
obtuseness in respect of Sismondi&#8217;s real concern, his ultimate
problem. The analysis of Marx at a later date, showing up the
crude mistakes of Adam Smith for the first time, is the best
proof that the problem of accumulation is far from solved just
by attending to the equivalent of the constant capital in the
aggregate product. This is proved even more strikingly in the
actual development of Sismondi&#8217;s theory: his views involved
him in bitter controversy with the exponents and popularisers of
the classical school, with Ricardo, Say and MacCulloch. The
two parties to the conflict represent diametrically opposed
points of view: Sismondi stands for the sheer impossibility, the
others for the unrestricted possibility, of accumulation. Sismondi
and his opponents alike disregard constant capital in their exposition
of reproduction, and it was Say in particular who
presumed to perpetuate Adam Smith&#8217;s confused concept of the
aggregate product as <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> as an unassailable dogma.</p>

<p>The knowledge we owe to Marx that the aggregate product
must, apart from consumer goods for the workers and capitalists
(<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>), also contain means of production to renew what has
been used, that accumulation accordingly consists not merely
in the enlargement of variable but also of constant capital, is
not enough, as amply demonstrated by this entertaining turn
of events, to solve the problem of accumulation. Later we shall
see how this stress on the share of constant capital in the reproductive
process gave rise to new fallacies in the theory of
accumulation. At present it will suffice to put on record that the
deference to Smith&#8217;s error about the reproduction of aggregate
capital is not a weakness unique to Sismondi&#8217;s position but is
rather the common ground on which the first controversy about
the problem of accumulation was fought out. Scientific research,
not only in this sphere, proceeds in devious ways; it often tackles
the upper storeys of the edifice, as it were, without making sure
of the foundations; and so this conflict only resulted in that
bourgeois economics took on the further complicated problem
of accumulation without even having assimilated the elementary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
problem of simple reproduction. At all events, Sismondi, in his
critique of accumulation, had indubitably given bourgeois
economics a hard nut to crack&mdash;seeing that in spite of his transparently
feeble and awkward deductions, Sismondi&#8217;s opponents
were still unable to get the better of him.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XI</i></h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Mac</span>CULLOCH <i>v.</i> SISMONDI</h2>

<p>Sismondi&#8217;s emphatic warnings against the ruthless ascendancy
of capital in Europe called forth severe opposition on
three sides: in England the school of Ricardo, in France
J. B. Say, the commonplace vulgariser of Adam Smith, and the
St. Simonians. While Owen in England, profoundly aware of
the dark aspects of the industrial system and of the crises in
particular, saw eye to eye with Sismondi in many respects, the
school of that other great European, St. Simon, who had
stressed the world-embracing conception of large industrial
expansion, the unlimited unfolding of the productive forces of
human labour, felt perturbed by Sismondi&#8217;s alarms. Here, however,
we are interested in the controversy between Sismondi and
the Ricardians which proved the most fruitful from the theoretical
point of view. In the name of Ricardo, and, it seemed, with
Ricardo&#8217;s personal approval, MacCulloch anonymously published
a polemical article<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>  against Sismondi in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
in October 1819, i.e. immediately after the publication
of the <i>Nouveaux Principes</i>.</p>

<p>In 1820, Sismondi replied in Rossi&#8217;s <i>Annales de Jurisprudence</i>
with an essay entitled: &#8216;Does the Power of Consuming Necessarily
Increase with the Power to Produce? An Enquiry.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>In his reply Sismondi<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>  himself states that his polemics were
conceived under the impact of the commercial crisis: &#8216;This
truth we are both looking for, is of utmost importance under
present conditions. It may be considered as fundamental for
economics. Universal distress is in evidence in the trade, in
industry and, in many countries certainly, even in agriculture.
Such prolonged and extraordinary suffering has brought misfortune
to countless families and insecurity and despondency to
all, until it threatens the very bases of the social order. Two
contrasting explanations have been advanced for the distress
that has caused such a stir. Some say: we have produced too
much, and others: we have not produced enough. &#8220;There will
be no equilibrium,&#8221; say the former, &#8220;no peace and no prosperity
until we consume the entire commodity surplus which
remains unsold on the market, until we organise production for
the future in accordance with the buyers&#8217; demand.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;There
will be a new equilibrium,&#8221; say the latter, &#8220;if only we double
our efforts to accumulate as well as to produce. It is a mistake
to believe that there is a glut on the market; no more than half
our warehouses are full; let us fill the other half, too, and the
mutual exchange of these new riches will revive our trade.&#8221;&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
In this supremely lucid way, Sismondi sets out and underlines
the real crux of the dispute. MacCulloch&#8217;s whole position in
truth stands or falls with the statement that exchange is actually
an interchange of commodities; every commodity accordingly
represents not only supply but demand. The dialogue then
continues as follows:</p>

<p>&#8216;Demand and supply are truly correlative and convertible
terms. The supply of one set of commodities constitutes the
demand for another. Thus, there is a demand for a given
quantity of agricultural produce, when a quantity of wrought
goods equal thereto in productive cost is offered in exchange for
it; and conversely, there is an effectual demand for this quantity
of wrought goods, when the supply of agricultural produce
which it required the same expense to raise, is presented as its
equivalent.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>The Ricardian&#8217;s dodge is obvious: he has chosen to ignore the
circulation of money and to pretend that commodities are immediately
bought and paid for by commodities.</p>

<p>From the conditions of highly developed capitalist production,
we are thus suddenly taken to a stage of primitive barter
such as we might find still flourishing at present in Central
Africa. There is a distant element of truth in this trick since
money, in a simple circulation of commodities, plays merely the
part of an agent. But of course, it is just the intervention of an
agent which separates the two transactions of circulation, sale
and purchase, and makes them independent of one another in
respect of both time and place. That is why a further purchase
need not follow hard upon a sale for one thing; and secondly,
sale and purchase are by no means bound up with the same
people: in fact, they will involve the same performers only in
rare and exceptional cases. MacCulloch, however, makes just
this baseless assumption by confronting, as buyer and seller,
industry on the one hand and agriculture on the other. The
universality of these categories, <i>qua</i> total categories of exchange,
obscures the actual splitting up of this social division of labour
which results in innumerable private exchange transactions
where the sale and purchase of two commodities rarely come to
the same thing. MacCulloch&#8217;s simplified conception of commodity
exchange in general which immediately turns the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
commodity into money and pretends that it can be directly
exchanged, makes it impossible to understand the economic
significance of money, its historical appearance.</p>

<p>Sismondi&#8217;s answer to this is regrettably clumsy. In order to
show that MacCulloch&#8217;s explanation of commodity exchange
has no application for capitalist production, he takes recourse
to the Leipsic Book Fair.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>&#8216;At the Book Fair of Leipsic, booksellers from all over Germany
arrive, each with four or five publications of his own in
some 40 or 50 dozen copies; these are exchanged for others and
every seller takes home 200 dozen books, just as he has brought
200 dozen, with the sole difference, that he brought four different
works and takes home 200. This is the demand and the
production which, according to M. Ricardo&#8217;s disciple, are correlative
and convertible; one buys the other, one pays for the
other, one is the consequence of the other. But as far as we
are concerned, for the bookseller and for the general public,
demand and consumption have not even begun. For all that it
has changed hands at Leipsic, a bad book will still be just as
unsold (a bad mistake of Sismondi&#8217;s, this!), it will still clutter
up the merchants&#8217; shops, either because nobody wants it, or
because everyone has a copy already. The books exchanged at
Leipsic will only sell if the booksellers can find individuals who
not only want them but are also prepared to make sacrifices in
order to withdraw them from circulation. They alone constitute
an effective demand.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>Although this example is rather crude, it shows clearly that
Sismondi was not side-tracked by his opponent&#8217;s trick, that he
knows after all what he is talking about.</p>

<p>MacCulloch then attempts to turn the examination from
abstract commodity exchange to concrete social conditions:
&#8216;Supposing, for the sake of illustration, that a cultivator
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
advanced food and clothing for 100 labourers, who raised for
him <i>food</i> for 200; while a master-manufacturer also advanced
food and clothing for 100, who fabricated for him <i>clothing</i> for
200. Then the farmer, besides replacing the food of his own
labourers, would have food for 100 to dispose of; while the
manufacturer, after replacing the clothing of his own labourers,
would have clothing for 100 to bring to market. In this case, the
two articles would be exchanged against each other, the supply
of food constituting the demand for the clothing, and that of the
clothing the demand for the food.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>What are we to admire more in this hypothesis: the absurdity
of the set-up which reverses all actual relations, or the effrontery
which simply takes for granted in the premises all that is later
claimed proved? In order to prove that it is always possible to
create an unlimited demand for all kinds of goods, MacCulloch
chooses for his example two commodities which pertain to the
most urgent and elementary wants of every human being: food
and clothing. In order to prove that commodities may be
exchanged at any time, and without regard to the needs of
society, he chooses for his example two products in quantities
which are right from the start in strict conformity with these
needs, and which therefore contain no surplus as far as society
is concerned. And yet he calls this quantity needed by society
a surplus&mdash;<i>viz.</i> as measured against the producer&#8217;s personal
requirements for his own product, and is consequently able to
demonstrate brilliantly that any amount of commodity &#8216;surplus&#8217;
can be exchanged for a corresponding &#8216;surplus&#8217; of other
commodities. Finally, in order to prove that different privately
produced commodities can yet be exchanged, although their
quantity, production costs and social importance must of course
be different, he chooses for his example commodities whose
quantity, production cost and general social necessity are precisely
the same right from the start. In short, MacCulloch posits
a planned, strictly regulated production without any over-production
in order to prove that no crisis is possible in an
unplanned private economy.</p>

<p>The principal joke of canny Mac, however, lies elsewhere.
What is at issue is the problem of accumulation. Sismondi was
worried by, and worried Ricardo and his followers with, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
following question: if part of the surplus value is capitalised, i.e.
used to expand production over and above the income of
society, instead of being privately consumed by the capitalists,
where are we to find buyers for the commodity surplus? What
will become of the capitalised surplus value? Who will buy
the commodities in which it is hidden? Thus Sismondi. And
the flower of Ricardo&#8217;s school, its official representative on the
Chair of London University, the authority for the then English
Ministers of the Liberal Party and for the City of London, the
great Mr. MacCulloch replies&mdash;by constructing an example in
which no surplus value whatever is produced. His &#8216;capitalists&#8217;
slave away in agriculture and industry in the name of charity,
and all the time the entire social product, including the &#8216;surplus&#8217;,
is only enough for the needs of the workers, for the wages,
while the &#8216;farmer&#8217; and &#8216;manufacturer&#8217; see to production and
exchange without food and clothing.</p>

<p>Sismondi, justly impatient, now exclaims: &#8216;The moment we
want to find out what is to constitute the surplus of production
over consumption of the workers, it will not do to abstract
from that surplus which forms the due profit of labour and the
due share of the master.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>MacCulloch&#8217;s only reaction is to multiply his silly argument
by a thousand. He asks the reader to assume &#8216;1,000 farmers&#8217;, and
&#8216;also 1,000 master-manufacturers&#8217; all acting as ingenuously as
the individuals. The exchange, then, proceeds as smoothly as
can be desired. Finally, he exactly doubles labour productivity
&#8216;in consequence of more skilful application of labour and of the
introduction of machinery&mdash;thus that every one of the 1,000
farmers, by advancing food and clothing for 100 labourers,
obtains a return consisting of ordinary food for 200 together
with sugar, grapes and tobacco equal in production cost to that
food&#8217;, while every manufacturer obtains, by an analogous procedure,
in addition to the previous quantity of clothing for all
workers, &#8216;ribbands, cambrics and lace, equal in productive cost,
and therefore in exchangeable value, to that clothing&#8217;.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>  After
such complete reversal of the chronological order, the assumption,
that is, of first the existence of private property with wage
labour, and then, at a later stage, such level of labour productivity
as makes exploitation possible at all, he now assumes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
labour productivity to progress with equal speed in all spheres,
the surplus product to contain precisely the same amount of
value in all branches of industry, and to be divided among
precisely the same number of people. When these various surplus
products are then exchanged against one another, is it any
wonder that the exchange proceeds smoothly and completely to
everybody&#8217;s satisfaction? It is only another of his many absurdities
that MacCulloch makes the capitalists who had hitherto
lived on air and exercised their profession in their birthday suits,
now live exclusively on sugar, tobacco and wine, and array
themselves only in ribbons, cambrics and lace.</p>

<p>The most ridiculous performance, however, is the <i>volte-face</i> by
which he evades the real problem. The question had been what
happens to the capitalist surplus, that surplus which is used not
for the capitalist&#8217;s own consumption but for the expansion of
production. MacCulloch solves it on the one hand by ignoring
the production of surplus value altogether, and on the other, by
using all surplus value in the production of luxury goods. What
buyers, then, does he advance for this new luxury production?
The capitalists, evidently; the farmers and manufacturers, since,
apart from these, there are only workers in MacCulloch&#8217;s
model. Thus the entire surplus value is consumed for the
personal satisfaction of the capitalists, that is to say, simple reproduction
takes place. The answer to the problem of the
capitalisation of surplus value is, according to MacCulloch,
either to ignore surplus value altogether, or to assume simple
reproduction instead of accumulation as soon as surplus value
comes into being. He still <i>pretends</i> to speak of expanding reproduction,
but again, as before when he pretended to deal with
the &#8216;surplus&#8217;, he uses a trick, <i>viz.</i> first setting out an impossible
species of capitalist production without any surplus value, and
then persuading the reader that the subsequent <i>début</i> of the
surplus value constitutes an expansion of production.</p>

<p>Sismondi is not quite up to these Scottish acrobatics. He had
up to now succeeded in pinning his Mac down, proving him to
be &#8216;obviously absurd&#8217;. But now he himself becomes confused
with regard to the crucial point at issue. On the above rantings
of his opponent, he should have declared coldly: Sir, with all
respect for the flexibility of your mind, you are dodging the
issue. I keep on asking, who will buy the surplus product, if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
capitalists use it for the purpose of accumulation, i.e. to expand
production, instead of squandering it altogether? And you
reply: Oh well, they will expand their production of luxury
goods, which they will, of course, eat up themselves. But this is
a conjuring trick, seeing that the capitalists consume the surplus
value in so far as they spend it on their luxuries&mdash;they do not
accumulate at all. My question is about the possibility of
accumulation, not whether the personal luxuries of the capitalists
are possible. Answer this clearly, if you can, or else go
play with your wine and tobacco, or go to blazes for all
I care.</p>

<p>But Sismondi, instead of putting the screws on the vulgariser,
suddenly begins to moralise with pathos and social conscience.
He exclaims: &#8216;Whose demand? Whose satisfaction? The masters
or the workers in town or country? On this new conception [of
Mac&#8217;s] there is a surplus of products, an advantage from labour&mdash;to
whom will it accrue?&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>  and gives his own answer in the
following impassioned words: &#8216;But we know full well, and the
history of the commercial world teaches us all too thoroughly,
that it is not the worker who profits from the increase in products
and labour; his pay is not in the least swelled by it. M.
Ricardo himself said formerly that it ought not to be, unless you
want the social wealth to stop growing. On the contrary, sorry
experience teaches us that wages nearly always contract by very
reason of this increase. Where, then, does the accumulation of
wealth make itself felt as a public benefit? Our author assumes
1,000 farmers who profit, while 100,000 workers toil; 1,000
entrepreneurs who wax rich, while 100,000 artisans are kept
under their orders. Whatever good may result from the accumulation
of the frivolous enjoyment of luxuries is only felt by a
100th part of the nation. And will this 100th part, called upon
to consume the entire surplus product of the whole working
class, be adequate to a production that may grow without let or
hindrance, owing to progress of machinery and capitals? In the
assumption made by the author, every time the national product
is doubled, the master of the farm or of the factory must
increase his consumption a hundredfold; if the national wealth
to-day, thanks to the invention of so many machines, is a
hundred times what it was when it only covered the cost of production,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
every employer would to-day have to consume enough
products to support 10,000 workers.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>At this point Sismondi again believes himself to have a firm
grasp on how crises begin to arise: &#8216;We might imagine, if put to
it, that a rich man can consume the goods manufactured by
10,000 workers, this being the fate of the ribbons, lace and
cambrics whose origin the author has shown us. But a single
individual would not know how to consume agricultural product
to the same tune, the wines, sugar and spices which
M. Ricardo [whom Sismondi evidently suspected of having
written the article since he only got to know &#8216;Anonymous&#8217; of the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i> at a later date] conjures up in exchange, are
too much for the table of one man. They will not sell, or else the
strict proportion between agricultural and industrial products,
apparently the basis of his whole system, cannot be maintained.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Sismondi, we see, has thus fallen into MacCulloch&#8217;s trap.
Instead of waiving an answer to the problem of accumulation
which refers to the production of luxuries, he pursues his opponent
into this field without noticing that the ground under his
feet has shifted. Here he finds two causes for complaint. For one
thing, he has moral objections to MacCulloch&#8217;s allowing the
capitalists instead of the workers to benefit by the surplus value,
and is side-tracked into polemising against distribution under
capitalism. From this digression, he unexpectedly reverts to the
original problem which he now formulates as follows: the capitalists,
then, consume the entire surplus value in luxuries. Let it
be so. But could anyone increase his consumption as rapidly
and indefinitely as the progress of labour productivity makes the
surplus value increase? And in this second instance, Sismondi
himself abandons his own problem. Instead of perceiving that it
is the lack of consumers other than workers and capitalists
which accounts for the difficulty in capitalist accumulation, he
discovers a snag in simple reproduction because the capitalists&#8217;
capacity to consume has physical limits. Since the absorptive
capacity of the capitalists for luxuries cannot keep up with
labour productivity, that is to say with the increase in surplus
value, there must be crises and over-production. We have
encountered this line of thought once before in the <i>Nouveaux
Principes</i>&mdash;so Sismondi himself was manifestly not quite clear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
about the problem at all times. And that is hardly surprising,
since one can really come to grips with the whole problem of
accumulation only when one has fully grasped the problem of
simple reproduction, and we have seen how much Sismondi was
at fault in this respect.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of all this, the first time that Sismondi crossed
swords with the heirs of the classical school, he proved himself
by no means the weaker party. On the contrary, in the end he
routed his opponent. If Sismondi misunderstood the most
elementary principles of social reproduction and ignored constant
capital, quite in keeping with Adam Smith&#8217;s dogma, he
was in this respect no worse at any rate than his opponent. Constant
capital does not exist for MacCulloch either, his farmers
and manufacturers &#8216;advance&#8217; merely food and clothing to their
workers, and food and clothing between them make up the
aggregate product of society. If there is, then, nothing to choose
between the two as far as this elementary blunder is concerned,
Sismondi towers heads above Mac because of his intuitive
understanding of the contradictions in the capitalist mode of
production. In the end, the Ricardian was at a loss to answer
Sismondi&#8217;s scepticism concerning the possibility of realising the
surplus value. Sismondi also shows himself more penetrating in
that he throws the Nottingham proletarians&#8217; cry of distress in
the teeth of the apostles and apologists of harmony with their
smug complacency, of those who deny &#8216;any surplus of production
over demand, any congestion of the market, any suffering&#8217;,
when he proves that the introduction of the machine must of
necessity create a &#8216;superabundant population&#8217;, and particularly
in the end, when he underlines the tendency of the capitalist
world market in general with its inherent contradictions. MacCulloch
denies outright that general over-production is possible.
He has a specific for every partial over-production up his sleeve:</p>

<p>&#8216;It may be objected, perhaps, that on the principle that the
demand for commodities increases in the same ratio as their
supply, there is no accounting for the gluts and stagnation produced
by overtrading. We answer very easily&mdash;A glut is an
increase in the supply of a particular class of commodities, unaccompanied
by a corresponding increase in the supply of those
other commodities which should serve as their equivalents.
While our 1,000 farmers and 1,000 master-manufacturers are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
exchanging their respective surplus products, and reciprocally
affording a market to each other, if 1,000 new capitalists were
to join their society, employing each 100 labourers in tillage,
there would be an immediate glut in agricultural produce ...
because in this case there would be no contemporaneous increase
in the supply of the manufactured articles which should
purchase it. But let one half of the new capitalists become
manufacturers, and equivalents in the form of wrought goods
will be created for the new produce raised by the other half:
the equilibrium will be restored, and the 1,500 farmers and
1,500 master-manufacturers will exchange their respective
surplus products with exactly the same facility with which the
1,000 farmers and 1,000 manufacturers formerly exchanged
theirs.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>Sismondi answers this buffoonery which &#8216;very easily&#8217; pokes
about in a fog, by pointing to the real changes and revolutions
which take place before his own eyes. &#8216;It was possible to put
barbarous countries under the plough, and political revolutions,
changes in the financial system, and peace, at once brought
cargoes to the ports of the old agricultural countries which
almost equalled their entire harvest. The recent Russian conquest
of the vast provinces on the Black Sea, the change in the
system of government in Egypt, and the outlawing of piracy
in High Barbary, have suddenly poured the granaries of Odessa,
Alexandria and Tunis into the Italian ports and have put such
an abundance of corn on the markets that all along the coasts
the farmer&#8217;s trade is fighting a losing battle. Nor is the remainder
of Europe safe from a similar revolution, caused by the
simultaneous ploughing under of immense expanses of new land
on the banks of the Mississippi, which export all their agricultural
produce. Even the influence of New Holland may one
day be the ruin of English industry, if not in the price of foodstuffs,
which are too expensive to transport, at least in respect of
wool and other agricultural products which are easier to
transport.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>What would MacCulloch have to advise in view of such an
agrarian crisis in Southern Europe? That half the new farmers
should turn manufacturer. Whereupon Sismondi counters:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
&#8216;Such counsel cannot seriously apply to the Tartars of the
Crimea or to the fellaheen of Egypt.&#8217; And he adds: &#8216;The time
is not yet ripe to set up new industries in the regions oversea or
in New Holland.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>Sismondi&#8217;s acuity recognised that industrialisation of the
lands overseas was only a matter of time. He was equally aware
of the fact that the expansion of the world market would not
bring with it the solution to the difficulty but would only reproduce
it in a higher degree, in yet more potent crises. His prediction
for the expansive tendency of capitalism is that it will
reveal an aspect of fiercer and fiercer competition, of mounting
anarchy within production itself. Indeed, he puts his finger on
the fundamental causes of crises in a passage where he states the
trend of capitalist production precisely as surpassing all limits of
the market. At the end of his reply to MacCulloch he says:
&#8216;Time and again it has been proclaimed that the equilibrium
will re-establish itself, that work will start again, but a single
demand each time provides an impetus in excess of the real
needs of trade, and this new activity must soon be followed by a
yet more painful glut.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>To such a profound grasp of the real contradictions in the
movements of capital, the <i>vulgarus</i> on the Chair of London
University with his harmony cant and his country-dance of
1,000 beribboned farmers and 1,000 bibulous manufacturers
could find no effective answer.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XII</i></h2>

<h2>RICARDO <i>v.</i> SISMONDI</h2>

<p>MacCulloch&#8217;s reply to Sismondi&#8217;s theoretical objections
evidently did not settle the matter to Ricardo&#8217;s
own satisfaction. Unlike that shrewd &#8216;Scottish arch-humbug&#8217;,
as Marx calls him, Ricardo really wanted to discover
the truth and throughout retained the genuine modesty of a
great mind.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>  That Sismondi&#8217;s polemics against him and his
pupil had made a deep impression is proved by Ricardo&#8217;s revised
approach to the question of the effects of the machine,
that being the point on which Sismondi, to his eternal credit,
had confronted the classical school of harmony with the sinister
aspects of capitalism. Ricardo&#8217;s followers had enlarged upon the
doctrine that the machine can always create as many or even
more opportunities for the wage labourers as it takes away by
displacing living labour. This so-called theory of compensation
was subjected to a stern attack by Sismondi in the chapter &#8216;On
the Division of Labour and Machinery&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>  and in another chapter
significantly entitled: &#8216;Machinery Creates a Surplus Population&#8217;,<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
both published in the <i>Nouveaux Principes</i> of 1819, two
years later than Ricardo&#8217;s main work. In 1821, after the MacCulloch-Sismondi
controversy, Ricardo inserted a new chapter
in the third edition of his <i>Principles</i>, where he frankly confesses
to his error and says in the strain of Sismondi: &#8216;That the opinion
entertained by the labouring classes, that the employment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
machinery is frequently detrimental to their interests, is not
founded on prejudice and error, but is conformable to the
correct principles of political economy.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>He, like Sismondi, had to defend himself against the suspicion
that he is opposing technical progress, but, less ruthless, he compromises
with the evasion that the evil emerges only gradually.
&#8216;To elucidate the principle, I have been supposing, that improved
machinery is <i>suddenly</i> discovered, and extensively used;
but the truth is, that these discoveries are gradual, and rather
operate in determining the employment of the capital which is
saved and accumulated, than in diverting capital from its actual
employment.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>Yet the problem of crises and accumulation continued to
worry Ricardo also. In 1823, the last year of his life, he spent
some days in Geneva in order to talk the problem over face to
face with Sismondi. The result of these talks is Sismondi&#8217;s essay
&#8216;On the Balance Between Consumption and Production&#8217;, published
in the <i>Revue Encyclopédique</i> of May 1824.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>In his <i>Principles</i>, Ricardo had at the crucial points completely
accepted Say&#8217;s trite doctrine of harmony in the relations between
production and consumption. In chapter xxi he had
declared: &#8216;M. Say has, however, most satisfactorily shown, that
there is no amount of capital which may not be employed in a
country, because demand is only limited by production. No
man produces, but with a view to consume or sell, and he never
sells, but with an intention to purchase some other commodity,
which may be immediately useful to him, or which may contribute
to future production. By producing, then, he necessarily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
becomes either the consumer of his own goods, or the purchaser
and consumer of the goods of some other person.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>To this conception of Ricardo&#8217;s, Sismondi&#8217;s <i>Nouveaux Principes</i>
were a powerful challenge, and the dispute as a whole turned
also on this point. Ricardo could not deny the fact of crises
which had but recently passed over England and other countries.
What was at issue was the explanation for them. Right at
the outset of their debate, Sismondi and Ricardo had agreed on
a remarkably lucid and precise formulation of the problem,
excluding the question of foreign commerce altogether. Sismondi
grasped the significance and necessity of foreign trade for
capitalist production, its need for expansion, well enough; in
this line he was quite in step with Ricardo&#8217;s Free Traders,
whom he considerably excelled in his dialectical conception of
the expansionist needs of capital. He fully admitted that industry
&#8216;is increasingly led to look for its vents on foreign markets
where it is threatened by greater revolutions&#8217;.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>  He forecast, as
we have seen, the rise of a dangerous competition for European
industry in the overseas countries. This was after all a creditable
achievement in the year 1820, and one which reveals Sismondi&#8217;s
deep insight into the relations of capitalist world economy. But
even so, Sismondi was in fact far from conceiving the problem
of realising the surplus value, the problem of accumulation, to
depend on foreign commerce as its only means of salvation, a
view attributed to him by later critics. On the contrary, Sismondi
was quite explicit in the sixth chapter of volume i:<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>  &#8216;In
order to make these calculations with greater certainty and to
simplify these questions, we have hitherto made complete
abstraction from foreign trade and supposed an isolated nation;
this isolated nation is human society itself, and what is true for a
nation without foreign commerce, is equally true for mankind.&#8217;</p>

<p>In other words: in considering the entire world market as one
society producing exclusively by capitalist methods, Sismondi
grounds his problem in the same premises as Marx was to do
after him. That was also the basis on which he came to terms
with Ricardo. &#8216;From the question that troubled us, we had each
of us dismissed the instance of a nation that sold more abroad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
than it needed to buy there, that could command a growing
external market for its growing internal production. In any case,
it is not for us to decide whether fortunes of war or politics
could perhaps bring forth new consumers for a nation&mdash;what is
needed is proof that a nation can create these for itself simply by
increasing its production.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>This is how Sismondi formulated the problem of realising the
surplus value in all precision, just as it confronts us throughout
the ensuing era in economics, in contrast with Ricardo who
actually maintains along with Say, as we are already aware and
shall show in further detail, that production creates its own
demand.</p>

<p>Ricardo&#8217;s thesis in the controversy with Sismondi takes the
following form: &#8216;Supposing that 100 workers produce 1,000
sacks of corn, and 100 weavers 1,000 yards woollen fabric. Let
us disregard all other products useful to man and all intermediaries
between them, and consider them alone in the world.
They exchange their 1,000 yards against the 1,000 sacks. Supposing
that the productive power of labour has increased by a
tenth owing to a successive progress of industry, the same people
will exchange 1,100 yards against 1,100 sacks, and each will
be better clothed and fed; new progress will make them exchange
1,200 yards for 1,200 sacks, and so on. The increase in
products always only increases the enjoyment of those who
produce.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>The great Ricardo&#8217;s standards of reasoning, it must regretfully
be stated, are if anything even lower than those of the
Scottish arch-humbug, MacCulloch. Once again we are invited
to witness a harmonious and graceful country-dance of sacks
and yards&mdash;the very proportion which is to be proved, is again
taken for granted. What is more, all relevant premises for the
problem are simply left out. The real problem&mdash;you will recollect&mdash;the
object of the controversy had been the question:
who are the buyers and consumers of the surplus product that
comes into being if the capitalists produce more goods than are
needed for their own and their workers&#8217; consumption; if, that
is to say, they capitalise part of their surplus value and use it
to expand production, to increase their capital? Ricardo answers
it by completely ignoring the capital increase. The picture he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
paints of the various stages of production is merely that of a
gradually increasing productivity of labour. According to his
assumptions, the same amount of labour first produces 1,000
sacks and 1,000 yards textiles, then 1,100 sacks and 1,100 yards,
further 1,200 sacks and 1,200 yards, and so on, in a gracefully
ascending curve. Not only that the image of a marshalled
uniform progression on both sides, of conformity even in the
number of objects brought to exchange, is wearisome, the
expansion of capital is nowhere as much as mentioned in the
model. Here we have no enlarged but simple reproduction with
a greater bulk of use-values indeed, but without any increase
in the value of the aggregate social product. Since only the
amount of value, not the number of use-values is relevant to
the exchange transaction, and this amount remains constant in
the example, Ricardo makes no real advances, even though he
seems to analyse the progressive expansion of production.
Finally, he is quite oblivious of the relevant categories of reproduction.
MacCulloch had begun by making the capitalists produce
without any surplus value and live on air, but at least he
recognised the existence of the workers, making provision for
their consumption. Ricardo, however, does not even mention
the workers; for him the distinction between variable capital
and surplus value does not exist at all. Besides this major
omission, it is of small account that he, just like his disciple,
takes no notice of constant capital. He wants to solve the problem
of realising the surplus value and expanding capital without
positing more than the existence of a certain quantity of
commodities which are mutually exchanged.</p>

<p>Sismondi was blind to the fact that the venue has been
changed altogether. Yet he tried faithfully to bring the fantasies
of his famous guest and opponent down to earth and to analyse
their invisible contradictions, plaintively saying that these
assumptions, &#8216;just like German metaphysics, abstract from time
and space&#8217;.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>  He grafts Ricardo&#8217;s hypothesis on to &#8216;society in its
real organisation, with unpropertied workers whose wage is
fixed by competition and who can be dismissed the moment
their master has no further need of their work ... for&#8217;&mdash;remarks
Sismondi, as acute as he is modest&mdash;&#8216;it is just this social organisation
to which our objection refers&#8217;.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
He lays bare the many difficulties and conflicts bound up
with the progress of labour productivity under capitalism, and
shows that Ricardo&#8217;s postulated changes in the technique of
labour, from the point of view of society, lead to the following
alternative: Either a number of workers corresponding to the
increase in labour productivity will have to be dismissed outright&mdash;then
there will be a surplus of products on the one hand,
and on the other unemployment and misery&mdash;a faithful picture
of present-day society. Or the surplus product will be used for
the maintenance of the workers in a new field of production,
the production of luxury goods. Here Sismondi undoubtedly
proves himself superior: he suddenly remembers the existence
of the constant capital, and now it is he who subjects the
English classic to a frontal attack:</p>

<p>&#8216;For setting up a new industry for manufacturing luxuries,
new capital is also needed; machines will have to be built, raw
materials procured, and distant commerce brought into activity;
for the wealthy are rarely content with enjoying what is immediately
in front of them. Where, then, could we find this new
capital which may perhaps be much more considerable than
that required by agriculture?... Our luxury workers are still a
long way from eating our labourers&#8217; grain, from wearing the
clothes from our common factories; they are not yet made into
workers, they may not even have been born yet, their trade does
not exist, the materials on which they are to work have not
arrived from India. All those among whom the former should
distribute their bread, wait for it in vain.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>Sismondi now takes constant capital into account, not only
in the production of luxuries, but also in agriculture, and
further raises the following objection against Ricardo: &#8216;We must
abstract from time, if we make the assumption that the cultivator,
whom a mechanical discovery or an invention of rural
industry enables to treble the productive power of his workers,
will also find sufficient capital to treble his exploitation, his
agricultural implements, his equipment, his livestock, his granaries:
to treble the circulating capital which must serve him
while waiting for his harvest.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>In this way Sismondi breaks with the superstition of the
classical school that with capital expanding all additional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
capital would be exclusively spent on wages, on the variable
capital. He clearly dissents from Ricardo&#8217;s doctrine&mdash;which did
not, however, prevent his allowing all the errors arising out of
this doctrine three years later again to creep into the second
edition of his <i>Nouveaux Principes</i>. In opposition to Ricardo&#8217;s facile
doctrine of harmony, Sismondi underlines two decisive points:
on the one hand, the objective difficulties of the process of
enlarged reproduction which works by no means so smoothly in
capitalist reality as it does in Ricardo&#8217;s absurd hypothesis; on
the other hand, the fact that all technical progress in social
labour productivity is always achieved under capitalism at the
expense of the working class, bought with their suffering. Sismondi
shows himself superior to Ricardo in yet a third point:
he represents the broad horizon of the dialectical approach as
against Ricardo&#8217;s blunt narrow-mindedness with its incapacity
to conceive of any forms of society other than those of bourgeois
economics:</p>

<p>&#8216;Our eyes,&#8217; he exclaims, &#8216;are so accustomed to this new
organisation of society, this universal competition, degenerating
into hostility between the rich and the working class, that we no
longer conceive of any mode of existence other than that whose
ruins surround us on all sides. They believe to prove me absurd
by confronting me with the vices of preceding systems. Indeed,
as regards the organisation of the lower classes, two or three
systems have succeeded one another; yet, since they are not to
be regretted, since, after first doing some good, they then imposed
terrible disasters on mankind, may we conclude from this
that we have now entered the true one? May we conclude that
we shall not discover the besetting vice of the system of wage
labour as we have discovered that of slavery, of vassalage, and
of the guilds? A time will come, no doubt, when our descendants
will condemn us as barbarians because we have left the
working classes without security, just as we already condemn,
as they also will, as barbarian the nations who have reduced
those same classes to slavery.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>Sismondi&#8217;s statement, putting in a nutshell the vital differences
between the parts played by the proletariat in a modern
society and in the society of ancient Rome, shows his profound
insight into historical connections. He shows no less discernment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
in his polemics against Ricardo, when analysing the
specific economic character of the slave-system and of feudal
economy as well as their relative historical significance, and
finally when emphasising, as the dominant universal tendency
of bourgeois economy, &#8216;that it severs completely all kind of
property from every kind of labour&#8217;.</p>

<p>The second round, no more than the first, between Sismondi
and the classical school, brought little glory for Sismondi&#8217;s
opponents.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XIII</i></h2>

<h2>SAY <i>v</i>. SISMONDI</h2>

<p>Sismondi&#8217;s essay against Ricardo in the <i>Revue Encyclopédique</i>
of May 1824, was the final challenge for J. B. Say, at that
time the acknowledged &#8216;prince of economic science&#8217; (<i>prince
de la science économique</i>), the so-called representative, heir and
populariser of the school of Adam Smith on the Continent. Say,
who had already advanced some arguments against Sismondi in
his letters to Malthus, countered the following July with an
essay on &#8216;The Balance Between Consumption and Production&#8217;
in the <i>Revue Encyclopédique</i>, to which Sismondi in turn published
a short reply. The chronology of Sismondi&#8217;s polemical engagements
was thus inverse to the sequence of the opposing theories,
for it had been Say who first communicated his doctrine of a
divinely established balance between production and consumption
to Ricardo who had in turn handed it down to MacCulloch.
In fact, as early as 1803, Say, in his <i>Traité d&#8217;Économie
Politique</i>, book i, chapter xii, had coined the following peremptory
statement: &#8216;Products are paid for with other products.
It follows that if a nation has too many goods of one kind, the
means of selling them would be to create goods of a different
kind.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>Here we meet again the all too familiar conjuring recipe
which was accepted alike by Ricardo&#8217;s school and by the &#8216;vulgar
economists&#8217; as the corner-stone of the doctrine of harmony.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Essentially, Sismondi&#8217;s principal work constitutes a sustained
polemic against this thesis. At this stage Say charges to the
attack in the <i>Revue Encyclopédique</i> with a complete <i>volte-face</i>, as
follows:</p>

<p>&#8216;Objection may be made that, because of man&#8217;s intelligence,
because of the advantage he can draw from the means provided
by nature and artifice, every human society can produce <i>all</i> the
things fit to satisfy its needs and increase its enjoyment in far
larger quantities than it can itself consume. But there I would
ask how it is possible that we know of no nation that is supplied
with everything. Even in what rank as prospering nations seven-eighths
of the population are lacking in a multitude of things
considered necessities in ... I will not say a wealthy family, but in
a modest establishment. The village I live in at present lies in
one of the richest parts of France; yet in 19 out of 20 houses I
enter here, I see but the coarsest fare and nothing that makes
for the well-being of the people, none of the things the English
call comforts.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>There is something to admire about the effrontery of the
excellent Say. It was he who had maintained that in a capitalist
economy there could be no difficulties, no surplus, no crises and
no misery; since goods can be bought one for the other, we need
only go on producing more and more and everything in the
garden will be lovely. It was in Say&#8217;s hands that this postulate
had become a tenet of the doctrine of harmony, that doctrine
so typical of vulgar economics, which had evoked a sharp protest
from Sismondi who proved this view untenable. The latter
had shown that goods cannot be sold in any quantity you like,
but that a limit is set to the realisation of goods by the income of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
society in each case, by <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>; inasmuch as the wages of the
workers are depressed to a mere subsistence level, and inasmuch
as there is also a natural limit to the consumptive capacity of the
capitalist class, an expansion of production, Sismondi says, must
inevitably lead to slumps, crises and ever greater misery for the
great masses. Say&#8217;s come-back to this is masterly in its ingenuity:
If you will insist that over-production is possible, how can it
happen that there are so many people in our society who are
naked, hungry and in want? Pray, explain this contradiction if
you can. Say, whose own position excels by contriving blithely
to shrug off the circulation of money altogether by operating
with a system of barter, now censures his critic for speaking of
an over-abundance of products in relation not only to purchasing
power but to the real needs of society, and that although
Sismondi had left no doubt at all about this very salient point
of his deductions. &#8216;Even if there is a very great number of badly
fed, badly clothed and badly housed people in a society, the
society can only sell what it buys, and, as we have seen, it can
only buy with its income.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>A little further on, Say concedes this point but alleges that his
opponent has made a new mistake: &#8216;It is not consumers, then,
in which the nation is lacking,&#8217; he says, &#8216;but purchasing power.
Sismondi believes that this will be more extensive, when the
products are rare, when consequently they are dearer and their
production procures ampler pay for the workers.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>That is how Say attempts to degrade, in his own trite method
of thought, or better, method of canting, Sismondi&#8217;s theory
which attacked the very foundations of capitalist organisation
and its mode of distribution. He burlesques the <i>Nouveaux Principes</i>,
turning them into a plea for &#8216;rare&#8217; goods and high prices,
and holds up to them the mirror of an artfully flattered capitalist
accumulation at its peak. If production becomes more vigorous,
he argues, labour grows in numbers and the volume of production
expands, the nations will be better and more universally
provided for, and he extols the conditions in countries where
industrial development is at its highest, as against the misery of
the Middle Ages. Sismondi&#8217;s maxims he declares subversive to
capitalist society: &#8216;Why does he call for an inquiry into the laws
which might oblige the entrepreneur to guarantee a living for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
the worker he employs? Such an inquiry would paralyse the
spirit of enterprise. Merely the fear that the authorities might
interfere with private contracts is a scourge and harmful to the
wealth of a nation.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>Not to be diverted from his purpose by this indiscriminate
apologia of Say&#8217;s, Sismondi once more turns the discussion on
the fundamental issue:</p>

<p>&#8216;Surely I have never denied that since the time of Louis XIV
France has been able to double her population and to quadruple
her consumption, as he contends. I have only claimed that the
increase of products is a good if it is desired, paid for and consumed;
that, on the other hand, it is an evil if, there being no
demand, the only hope of the producer is to entice the consumers
of a rival industry&#8217;s products. I have tried to show that
the natural course of the nations is progressive increase of their
property, an increase consequent upon their demand for new
products and their means to pay for them, but that in consequence
of our institutions, of our legislation having robbed the
working class of all property and every security, they have also
been spurred to a disorderly labour quite out of touch with the
demand and with purchasing power, which accordingly only
aggravates poverty.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>And he winds up the debate by inviting the preacher of harmony
to reflect upon the circumstance that, though a nation
may be rich, public misery no less than material wealth is constantly
on the increase, the class which produces everything
being daily brought nearer to a position where it may consume
nothing. On this shrill discordant note of capitalist contradictions
closes the first clash about the problem of accumulation.</p>

<p>Summing up the general direction of this first battle of wits,
we must note two points:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
(1) In spite of all the confusion in Sismondi&#8217;s analysis, his
superiority to both Ricardo and his followers and to the self-styled
heir to the mantle of Adam Smith is quite unmistakable.
Sismondi, in taking things from the angle of reproduction, looks
for concepts of value (capital and income) and for factual
elements (producer and consumer goods) as best he can, in
order to grasp how they are interrelated within the total social
process. In this he is nearest to Adam Smith, with the difference
only that the contradictions there appearing as merely
subjective and speculative, are deliberately stressed as the
keynote of Sismondi&#8217;s analysis where the problem of capital
accumulation is treated as the crucial point and principal
difficulty.</p>

<p>Sismondi has therefore made obvious advances on Adam
Smith, while Ricardo and his followers as well as Say throughout
the debate think solely in terms of simple commodity production.
They only see the formula C&mdash;M&mdash;C, even reducing everything
to barter, and believe that such barren wisdom can cover
all the problems specific to the process of reproduction and
accumulation. This is a regress even on Smith, and over such
myopic vision, Sismondi scores most decisively. He, the social
critic, evinces much more understanding for the categories of
bourgeois economics than their staunchest champions&mdash;just as,
at a later date, the socialist Marx was to grasp infinitely more
keenly than all bourgeois economists together the <i>differentia
specifica</i> of the mechanism of capitalist economy. If Sismondi
exclaims in the face of Ricardo&#8217;s doctrine: &#8216;What, is wealth to
be all, and man a mere nothing?&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>  it is indicative not only of the
vulnerable moral strain in his petty-bourgeois approach compared
to the stern, classical impartiality of Ricardo, but also of
a critical perception, sharpened by social sensibilities for the
living social connections of economy; an eye, that is, for intrinsic
contradictions and difficulties as against the rigid, hidebound
and abstract views of Ricardo and his school. The controversy
had only shown up the fact that Ricardo, just like the followers
of Adam Smith, was not even able to grasp, let alone solve the
puzzle of accumulation put by Sismondi.</p>

<p>(2) The clue to the problem, however, was already impossible
of discovery, because the whole argument had been side-tracked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
and concentrated upon the problem of crises. It is only natural
that the outbreak of the first crisis should dominate the discussion,
but no less natural that this effectively prevented either
side from recognising that crises are far from constituting <i>the</i>
problem of accumulation, being no more than its characteristic
phenomenon: one element in the cyclical form of capitalist reproduction.
Consequently, the debate could only result in a
twofold <i>quid pro quo</i>: one party deducing from crises that accumulation
is impossible, and the other from barter that crises are
impossible. Subsequent developments of capitalism were to give
the lie to both conclusions alike.</p>

<p>And yet, Sismondi&#8217;s criticism sounds the first alarm of economic
theory at the domination of capital, and for this reason
its historical importance is both great and lasting. It paves the
way for the disintegration of a classical economics unable to cope
with the problem of its own making. But for all Sismondi&#8217;s terror
of the consequences attendant upon capitalism triumphant, he
was certainly no reactionary in the sense of yearning for pre-capitalistic
conditions, even if on occasion he delights in extolling
the patriarchal forms of production in agriculture and
handicrafts in comparison with the domination of capital. He
repeatedly and most vigorously protests against such an interpretation
as e.g. in his polemic against Ricardo in the <i>Revue
Encyclopédique</i>:</p>

<p>&#8216;I can already hear the outcry that I jib at improvements in
agriculture and craftsmanship and at every progress man could
make; that I doubtless prefer a state of barbarism to a state of
civilisation, since the plough is a tool, the spade an even older
one, and that, according to my system, man ought no doubt to
work the soil with his bare hands.</p>

<p>&#8216;I never said anything of the kind, and I crave indulgence to
protest once for all against all conclusions imputed to my system
such as I myself have never drawn. Neither those who attack
me nor those who defend me have really understood me, and
more than once I have been put to shame by my allies as much
as by my opponents.&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;I beg you to realise that it is not the
machine, new discoveries and inventions, not civilisation to
which I object, but the modern organisation of society, an
organisation which despoils the man who works of all property
other than his arms, and denies him the least security in a reckless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
over-bidding that makes for his harm and to which he is
bound to fall a prey.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>There can be no question that the interests of the proletariat
were at the core of Sismondi&#8217;s criticism, and he is making no
false claims when he formulates his main tendency as follows:</p>

<p>&#8216;I am only working for means to secure the fruits of labour
to those who do the work, to make the machine benefit the man
who puts it in motion.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>When pressed for a closer definition of the social organisation
towards which he aspires, it is true he hedges and confesses himself
unable to do so:</p>

<p>&#8216;But what remains to be done is of infinite difficulty, and I
certainly do not intend to deal with it to-day. I should like to
convince the economists as completely as I am convinced myself
that their science is going off on a wrong tack. But I cannot trust
myself to be able to show them the true course; it is a supreme
effort&mdash;the most my mind will run to&mdash;to form a conception
even of the actual organisation of society. Yet who would have
the power to conceive of an organisation that does not even exist
so far, to see the future, since we are already hard put to it to
see the present?&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>Surely it was no disgrace to admit oneself frankly powerless to
envisage a future beyond capitalism in the year 1820&mdash;at a time
when capitalism had only just begun to establish its domination
over the big industries, and when the idea of socialism was only
possible in a most Utopian form. But, as Sismondi could neither
advance beyond capitalism nor go back to a previous stage, the
only course open to his criticism was a petty-bourgeois compromise.
Sceptical of the possibility of developing fully both
capitalism and the productive forces, he found himself under
necessity to clamour for some moderation of accumulation, for
some slowing down of the triumphant march of capitalism.
That is the reactionary aspect of his criticism.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XIV</i></h2>

<h2>MALTHUS</h2>

<p>At the same time as Sismondi, Malthus also waged war
against some of the teachings of Ricardo. Sismondi, in
the second edition of his work as well as in his polemics,
repeatedly referred to Malthus as an authority on his side. Thus
he formulated the common aims of his campaign against
Ricardo in the <i>Revue Encyclopédique</i>:</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Malthus, on the other hand, has maintained in England,
as I have tried to do on the Continent, that consumption
is not the necessary consequence of production, that the needs
and desires of man, though they are truly without limits, are
only satisfied by consumption in so far as means of exchange
go with them. We have affirmed that it is not enough to create
these means of exchange, to make them circulate among those
who have these desires and wants; that it can even happen frequently
that the means of exchange increase in society together
with a decrease in the demand for labour, or wages, so that the
desires and wants of one part of the population cannot be satisfied
and consumption also decreases. Finally, we have claimed
that the unmistakable sign of prosperity in a society is not an
increasing production of wealth, but an increasing demand for
labour, or the offer of more and more wages in compensation
for this labour. Messrs. Ricardo and Say, though not denying
that an increasing demand for labour is a symptom of prosperity,
maintained that it inevitably results from an increase of
production. As for Mr. Malthus and myself, we regard these
two increases as resulting from independent causes which may
at times even be in opposition. According to our view, if the
demand for labour has not preceded and determined production,
the market will be flooded, and then new production
becomes a cause of ruin, not of enjoyment.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>These remarks suggest far-reaching agreement, a brotherhood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
in arms of Sismondi and Malthus, at least in their opposition
against Ricardo and his school. Marx considers the <i>Principles of
Political Economy</i>, which Malthus published in 1820, an outright
plagiarism of the <i>Nouveaux Principes</i> which had been published
the year before. Yet Sismondi and Malthus are frequently at
odds regarding the problem with which we are here concerned.</p>

<p>Sismondi is critical of capitalist production, he attacks it
sharply, even denounces it, while Malthus stands for the defence.
This does not mean that he denies its inherent contradictions,
as Say or MacCulloch had done. On the contrary he raises
them quite unmercifully to the status of a natural law and
asserts their absolute sanctity. Sismondi&#8217;s guiding principle is
the interests of the workers. He aspires, though rather generally
and vaguely, towards a thoroughgoing reform of distribution in
favour of the proletariat. Malthus provides the ideology for
those strata who are the parasites of capitalist exploitation, who
live on ground rent and draw upon the common wealth, and
advocates the allocation of the greatest possible portion of the
surplus value to these &#8216;unproductive consumers&#8217;. Sismondi&#8217;s
general approach is predominantly ethical, it is the approach of
the social reformer. Improving upon the classics, he stresses, in
opposition to them, that &#8216;consumption is the only end of
accumulation&#8217;, and pleads for restricted accumulation. Malthus,
on the contrary, bluntly declares that production has no other
purpose than accumulation and advocates unlimited accumulation
by the capitalists, to be supplemented and assured by the
unlimited consumption of their parasites. Finally, Sismondi
starts off with a critical analysis of the reproductive process, of
the relation between capital and income from the point of view of
society; while Malthus, opposing Ricardo, begins with an absurd
theory of value from which he derives an equally absurd theory
of surplus value, attempting to explain capitalist profits as an
addition to the price over and above the value of commodities.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>Malthus opposes the postulate that supply and demand are
identical with a detailed critique in chapter vi of his <i>Definitions
in Political Economy</i>.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>  In his <i>Elements of Political Economy</i>, James
Mill had declared:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
&#8216;What is it that is necessarily meant, when we say that the
supply and the demand are accommodated to one another?
It is this: that goods which have been produced by a certain
quantity of labour, exchange for goods which have been produced
by an equal quantity of labour. Let this proposition be
duly attended to, and all the rest is clear.&mdash;Thus, if a pair of
shoes is produced with an equal quantity of labour as a hat, so
long as a hat exchanges for a pair of shoes, so long the supply
and demand are accommodated to one another. If it should so
happen, that shoes fell in value, as compared with hats, which
is the same thing as hats rising in value compared with shoes,
this would simply imply that more shoes had been brought to
market, as compared with hats. Shoes would then be in more
than the due abundance. Why? Because in them the produce
of a certain quantity of labour would not exchange for the produce
of an equal quantity. But for the very same reason hats
would be in less than the due abundance, because the produce
of a certain quantity of labour in them would exchange for the
produce of more than an equal quantity in shoes.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>Against such trite tautologies, Malthus marshals a twofold
argument. He first draws Mill&#8217;s attention to the fact that he is
building without solid foundations. In fact, he argues, even
without an alteration in the ratio of exchange between hats and
shoes, there may yet be too great a quantity of <i>both</i> in relation
to the demand. This will result in both being sold at less than
the cost of production plus an appropriate profit.</p>

<p>&#8216;But can it be said on this account&#8217;, he asks, &#8216;that the supply of
hats is suited to the demand for hats, or the supply of shoes
suited to the demand for shoes, when they are both so abundant
that neither of them will exchange for what will fulfil the
conditions of their continued supply?&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>In other words, Malthus confronts Mill with the possibility of
general over-production: &#8216;... when they are compared with the
costs of production ... it is evident that ... they may all fall
or rise at the same time&#8217;.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>Secondly, he protests against the way in which Mill, Ricardo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
and company are wont to model their postulates on a system of
barter: &#8216;The hop planter who takes a hundred bags of hops to
Weyhill fair, thinks little more about the supply of hats and
shoes than he does about the spots in the sun. What does he
think about, then? and what does he want to exchange his hops
for? Mr. Mill seems to be of opinion that it would show great
ignorance of political economy, to say that what he wants is
money; yet, notwithstanding the probable imputation of this
great ignorance, I have no hesitation in distinctly asserting, that
it really is money which he wants....&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>For the rest, Malthus is content to describe the machinery
by which an excessive supply can depress prices below the cost
of production and so automatically bring about a restriction of
production, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>&#8216;But this tendency, in the natural course of things, to cure a glut
or a scarcity, is no ... proof that such evils have never existed.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>It is clear that in spite of his contrary views on the question of
crises, Malthus thinks along the same lines as Ricardo, Mill,
Say, and MacCulloch. For him, too, everything can be reduced
to barter. The social reproductive process with its large categories
and interrelations which claimed the whole of Sismondi&#8217;s
attention, is here completely ignored.</p>

<p>In view of so many contradictions within the fundamental
approach, the criticism of Sismondi and Malthus have only a
few points in common: (1) Contrary to Say and the followers of
Ricardo, they both deny the hypothesis of a pre-established
balance of consumption and production. (2) They both maintain
that not only partial but also universal crises are possible.</p>

<p>But here their agreement ends. If Sismondi seeks the cause of
crises in the low level of wages and the capitalists&#8217; limited
capacity for consumption, Malthus, on the other hand, transforms
the fact of low wages into a natural law of population
movements; for the capitalists&#8217; limited capacity for consumption,
however, he finds a substitute in the consumption of the
parasites on surplus value such as the landed gentry and the
clergy with their unlimited capacity for wealth and luxury.
&#8216;The church with a capacious maw is blest.&#8217;</p>

<p>Both Malthus and Sismondi look for a category of consumers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
who buy without selling, in order to redeem capitalist accumulation
and save it from a precarious position. But Sismondi
needs them to get rid of the surplus product of society over and
above the consumption of the workers and capitalists, that is to
say, to get rid of the capitalised part of the surplus value.
Malthus wants them as &#8216;producers&#8217; of profit in general. It remains
entirely his secret, of course, how the <i>rentiers</i> and the
incumbents of the state can assist the capitalists in appropriating
their profits by buying commodities at an increased price, since
they themselves obtain their purchasing power mainly from
these capitalists. In view of these profound contrasts, the alliance
between Malthus and Sismondi does not go very deep.
And if Malthus, as Marx has it, distorts Sismondi&#8217;s <i>Nouveaux
Principes</i> into a Malthusian caricature, Sismondi in turn stresses
only what is common to them both and quotes Malthus in
support, giving the latter&#8217;s critique of Ricardo a somewhat Sismondian
cast. On occasion, no doubt, Sismondi actually succumbs
to the influence of Malthus; for instance, he takes over
the latter&#8217;s theory of reckless state expenditure as an emergency
measure in aid of accumulation and so becomes involved in
contradictions with his own initial assumptions.</p>

<p>On the whole, Malthus neither rendered an original contribution
to the problem of reproduction, nor even grasped it
fully. In his controversy with the followers of Ricardo, he operated
with the concepts of simple commodity circulation, just as
they did in their controversy with Sismondi. His quarrel with
that school turns on the &#8216;unproductive consumption&#8217; by the
parasites of the surplus value; it is not a quarrel about the social
foundations of capitalist reproduction. Malthus&#8217; edifice tumbles
to the ground as soon as the absurd mistakes in his theory of
profits are uncovered. Sismondi&#8217;s criticism remains valid, and
his problems remain unsolved even if we accept Ricardo&#8217;s
theory of value with all its consequences.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XV</i></h2>

<h2>v. KIRCHMANN&#8217;S THEORY OF
REPRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The second theoretical polemics about the problem of
accumulation was also started by current events. If the
first English crisis and its attendant misery of the working
class had stimulated Sismondi&#8217;s opposition against the classical
school, it was the revolutionary working-class movement
arisen since which, almost twenty-five years later, provided the
incentive for Rodbertus&#8217; critique of capitalist production. The
risings of the Lyons silk weavers and the Chartist movement in
England were vastly different from the shadowy spectres raised
by the first crisis, and the ears of the bourgeoisie were made to
ring with their criticism of the most wonderful of all forms of
society. The first socio-economic work of Rodbertus, probably
written for the <i>Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung</i> in the late thirties
but not published by that paper, bears the significant title, <i>The
Demands of the Working Classes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>  and begins as follows:</p>

<p>&#8216;What do the working classes want? Will the others be able to
keep it from them? Will what they want be the grave of modern
civilisation? Thoughtful people have long realised that a time
must come when history would put this question with great
urgency. Now, the man in the street has learned it too, from the
Chartist meetings and the Birmingham scenes.&#8217;</p>

<p>During the forties, the leaven of revolutionary ideas was most
vigorously at work in France in the formation of the various
secret societies and socialist schools of the followers of Proudhon,
Blanqui, Cabet, Louis Blanc, etc. The February revolution and
the June proclamation of the &#8216;right to work&#8217; led to a first head-on
clash between the two worlds of capitalist society&mdash;an epoch-making
eruption of the contradictions latent in capitalism. As
regards the other, visible form of those contradictions&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
crises&mdash;the available data for observation at the time of the
second controversy were far more comprehensive than in the
early twenties of the century. The dispute between Rodbertus
and v. Kirchmann took place under the immediate impact of
the crises in 1837, 1839, 1847, and even of the first world crisis
in 1857&mdash;Rodbertus writing his interesting pamphlet <i>On Commercial
Crises and the Mortgage Problem of the Landowners</i><a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>  in 1858.
Thus the inherent contradictions of capitalist society meeting
his eyes were in strident discord with the doctrine of harmony
held by the English classics and their vulgarisers both in England
and on the Continent, quite unlike any critique in the
times when Sismondi had raised his voice in warning.</p>

<p>Incidentally, a quotation from Sismondi in Rodbertus&#8217; first
writing proves that the former&#8217;s strictures immediately influenced
Rodbertus. He was thus familiar with contemporary
French writings against the classical school, though perhaps
less so with the far more numerous English literature. There is
no more than this flimsy support for the myth of the German
professors about the so-called &#8216;priority&#8217; of Rodbertus over Marx
in the &#8216;foundation of socialism&#8217;. Accordingly, Professor Diehl
writes in his article on Rodbertus in <i>Handwörterbuch der Staatswissenschaften</i>:
&#8216;Rodbertus must be considered the real founder
of scientific socialism in Germany, since in his writings between
1839 and 1842, even before Marx and Lassalle, he provided a
comprehensive socialist system, a critique of Adam Smith&#8217;s
doctrine, new theoretical foundations and proposals for social
reform.&#8217;</p>

<p>This piece of god-fearing, pious righteousness comes from the
second edition of 1901, after all that had been written by
Engels, Kautsky and Mehring to destroy this learned legend,
and in spite of it. Quite inevitably, of course, and proof against
any evidence to the contrary, however weighty, it was only
right in the eyes of all the learned German economists that the
palm of &#8216;priority&#8217; should be wrested from Marx, the revolutionary
anarchist, by Rodbertus, the &#8216;socialist&#8217; with monarchist,
Prussian and nationalist leanings, the man who believed in
communism five hundred years from now, but for the present
supported a steady exploitation rate of 200 per cent. However,
we are interested in another aspect of Rodbertus&#8217; analysis. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
same Professor Diehl continues his eulogy as follows: &#8216;Rodbertus
was not only a pioneer of socialism; political economy as a
whole owes much stimulation and furtherance to him; economic
theory in particular is indebted to him for the critique of
classical economics, for the new theory of the distribution of
income, for the distinction between the logical and historical
categories of capital, and so on.&#8217;</p>

<p>Here we shall deal with these latter achievements of Rodbertus,
especially with the &#8216;and so on&#8217;.</p>

<p>Rodbertus&#8217; decisive treatise, <i>Towards the Understanding of Our
Politico-Economic Conditions</i><a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>  of 1842, set the ball rolling. v. Kirchmann
replied in <i>Demokratische Blätter</i> with two essays&mdash;<i>On the
Social Aspects of Ground Rent</i><a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>  and <i>The Society of Barter</i><a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> &mdash;and
Rodbertus parried in 1850 with his <i>Letters on Social Problems</i>.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
Thus the discussion entered the same theoretical arena where
Malthus-Sismondi and Say-Ricardo-MacCulloch had fought
out their differences thirty years earlier. In his earliest writings,
Rodbertus had already expressed the thought that the wages of
labour present an ever diminishing part of the national product
in modern society where the productivity of labour is increasing.
He claimed this to be an original idea, and from that
moment until his death thirty years later he did nothing but
reiterate it and formulate it in various ways. This &#8216;declining
wage rate&#8217; is for him the root of all evils to be found in modern
society, in particular of pauperism and the crises, whose combination
he calls &#8216;the social problem of our times&#8217;.</p>

<p>v. Kirchmann does not agree with this explanation. He traces
pauperism back to the effects of a rising ground rent; crises, on
the other hand, to a lack of markets. About the latter especially
he says: &#8216;The greatest part of social ills is caused not by defects
of production but by a lack of markets for the products ... the
more a country can produce, the more means it has for satisfying
every need, the more it is exposed to the danger of misery
and want.&#8217;&mdash;The labour-problem is here included as well, for
&#8216;the notorious right to work ultimately reduces to the question
of markets&#8217;. &#8216;We see&#8217;, he concludes, &#8216;that the social problem
is almost identical with the problem of markets. Even the ills
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
of much-abused competition will vanish, once markets are
secure; its advantages alone will remain. There will remain a
spirit of rivalry to supply good and cheap commodities, but the
life-and-death struggle will disappear which is caused only by
insufficient markets.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>The difference between the points of view of Rodbertus and
v. Kirchmann is evident. Rodbertus sees the root of the evil in
a faulty distribution of the national product, and v. Kirchmann
in the limitations of the markets for capitalist production. Notwithstanding
all the confusion in his expositions, especially in
his idealist vision of a capitalist competition content with a
laudable rivalry for better and cheaper commodities, and also
in his conception of the &#8216;notorious right to work&#8217; as a problem
of markets, v. Kirchmann up to a point still shows more understanding
for the sore spot of capitalist production, i.e. the
limitations of its market, than Rodbertus who clings to distribution.
Thus it is v. Kirchmann who now takes up the problem
which Sismondi had originally put on the agenda. Nevertheless,
he by no means agrees with Sismondi&#8217;s elucidation and
solution of the problem, siding rather with the opponents of
the latter. Not only does he accept Ricardo&#8217;s theory of ground
rent, and Adam Smith&#8217;s dogma that &#8216;the price of the commodity
is composed of two parts only, of the interests on capital and
the wages of labour&#8217; (v. Kirchmann transforms the surplus
value into &#8216;interest on capital&#8217;); he also subscribes to the thesis
of Say and Ricardo that products are only bought with other
products and that production creates its own demand, so that if
one side appears to have produced too much, it only means
there was not enough production on the other. v. Kirchmann,
we see, faithfully follows the classics, if in a somewhat &#8216;German
edition&#8217;. He begins by arguing, e.g., that Say&#8217;s law of a natural
balance between production and demand &#8216;still does not give a
comprehensive picture of reality&#8217;, and adds:</p>

<p>&#8216;Commerce involves yet further hidden laws which prevent
this postulated order from obtaining in complete purity. They
must be discovered if we are to explain the present flooding of
the market, and their discovery might perhaps also show us the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
way to avoid this great evil. We believe that there are three
relations in the modern system of society which cause these
conflicts between Say&#8217;s indubitable law and reality.&#8217;</p>

<p>These relations are (1) &#8216;too inequitable a distribution of the
products&#8217;&mdash;here, as we see, v. Kirchmann somewhat approximates
to Sismondi&#8217;s point of view; (2) the difficulties which
nature puts in the way of human labour engaged in production;
and (3) finally, the defects of commerce as a mediator between
production and consumption. Disregarding the last two
obstacles to Say&#8217;s law, we shall now consider v. Kirchmann&#8217;s
reasoning of his first point.</p>

<p>&#8216;The first relation&#8217;, he explains, &#8216;can be put more briefly as
too low a wage of labour, which is thus the cause of a slump.
Those who know that the price of commodities is composed of
two parts only, of the interest on capital and the wage of labour,
might consider this a startling statement; if the wage of labour
is low, prices are low as well, and if one is high, so is the other.&#8217;</p>

<p>(We see v. Kirchmann accepts Smith&#8217;s dogma even in its
most misleading form: the price is not <i>resolved</i> into wage of
labour and surplus value, but is <i>composed</i> of them as a mere sum&mdash;a
view in which Adam Smith strayed furthest from his own
theory of the value of labour.)</p>

<p>&#8216;Wage and price thus are directly related, they balance each
other. England only abolished her corn laws, her tariffs on
meat and other victuals, in order to cause wages to fall and thus
to enable her manufacturers to oust all other competitors from
the world markets by means of still cheaper commodities. This,
however, only holds good up to a point and does not affect the
ratio in which the product is distributed among the workers
and the capitalists. Too inequitable a distribution among these
two is the primary and most important cause why Say&#8217;s law is
not fulfilled in real life, why the markets are flooded although
there is production in all branches.&#8217;</p>

<p>v. Kirchmann gives a detailed illustration of this statement.
Using the classical method, he takes us, of course, to an
imaginary isolated society which makes an unresisting, if thankless,
object for the experiments of political economy. v. Kirchmann
suggests we should imagine a place (<i>Ort</i>) which comprises
903 inhabitants, no more, no less, <i>viz.</i> three entrepreneurs with
300 workers each. <i>Ort</i> is to be able to satisfy all needs by its own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
production&mdash;in three establishments, that is to say, one for
clothing, a second for food, lighting, fuel and raw materials, and
a third for housing, furniture and tools. In each of these three
departments, the &#8216;capital together with the raw materials&#8217; is to
be provided by the entrepreneur, and the remuneration of the
workers is to be so arranged that the workers obtain as their
wage one half of the annual produce, the entrepreneur retaining
the other half &#8216;as interest on capital and profits of the enterprise&#8217;.
Every business is to produce just enough to satisfy all the
needs of the 903 inhabitants. <i>Ort</i> accordingly has &#8216;all the conditions
necessary for general well-being&#8217;, and everybody can
therefore tackle his work with courage and vigour. After a few
days, however, joy and delight turn into a universal misery and
gnashing of teeth: something has happened on v. Kirchmann&#8217;s
Island of the Blessed which was no more to be expected than
for the skies to fall: an industrial and commercial crisis according
to all modern specifications has broken out! Only the most
essential clothing, food and housing for the 900 workers has
been produced, yet the warehouses of the three entrepreneurs
are full of clothes and raw materials, and their houses stand
empty: they complain of a lack of demand, while the workers
in turn complain that their wants are not fully satisfied. What
has gone wrong? Could it be that there is too much of one kind
of produce and too little of another, as Say and Ricardo would
have it? Not at all, answers v. Kirchmann. Everything available
in <i>Ort</i> in well-balanced quantities, just enough to satisfy
all the wants of the community. What, then, has thrown a
spanner into the works, why the crisis? The obstruction caused
by distribution alone&mdash;but this must be savoured in v. Kirchmann&#8217;s
own words:</p>

<p>&#8216;The obstacle, why nevertheless no smooth exchange takes
place, lies solely and exclusively in the distribution of these
products. They are not distributed equitably among all, but the
entrepreneurs retain half of them for themselves as interest and
profit, and only give half to the workers. It is clear that the
worker in the clothing department can exchange, against half
of his product, only half of the food, lodging, etc., that has been
produced, and it is clear that the entrepreneur cannot get rid
of the other half since no worker has any more products to give
in exchange. The entrepreneurs do not know what to do with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
their stocks, the workers do not know what to do for hunger
and nakedness.&#8217;</p>

<p>Nor does the reader, we might add, know what to do with
v. Kirchmann&#8217;s constructions. His model is so childish that
every advance leads deeper into the maze.</p>

<p>First of all, there seems to be no reason whatever why, and
to what purpose, v. Kirchmann should devise this splitting-up
of production into three parts. If analogous examples by
Ricardo and MacCulloch usually confront tenant farmers and
manufacturers, that is presumably only inspired by the antiquated
Physiocrat conception of social reproduction which
Ricardo had adopted, although his own theory of value as
against the Physiocrats deprived it of all meaning, and although
Adam Smith had already made a good start in considering the
real material foundations of the social reproductive process.
Still, we have seen that the tradition of distinguishing between
agriculture and industry as the foundation of reproduction was
kept up in economic theory until Marx introduced his epoch-making
distinction of the two productive departments in society
for producer and consumer goods. v. Kirchmann&#8217;s three departments,
however, have no real significance at all. Obviously, no
material consideration of reproduction can have been responsible
for this supremely arbitrary division which jumbles up
tools and furniture, raw materials and food, but makes clothing
a department in its own right. One might as well postulate one
department for food, clothing and housing, another for medicines
and a third for tooth brushes. v. Kirchmann&#8217;s primary
concern, no doubt, is with the social division of labour; hence
the assumption of as nearly equal quantities of products as
possible in the transactions of exchange. Yet this exchange, on
which the argument turns, plays no part at all in v. Kirchmann&#8217;s
example since it is not the value which is distributed
but the quantities of products, the bulk of use-values as such.
In this intriguing <i>Ort</i> of v. Kirchmann&#8217;s imagining, again, the
products are distributed first, and only afterwards, when the
distribution is accomplished, is there to be universal exchange,
whereas on the solid ground of capitalist production it is, as we
know, the exchange which inaugurates the distribution of the
product and serves as its agent. Besides, the queerest things
happen in v. Kirchmann&#8217;s distributive system: &#8216;As we all know&#8217;,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
the prices of the products, i.e. the price of the aggregate product
of society, consist of <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>, of wage and capital interest alone&mdash;so
that the aggregate product must be distributed entirely
among workers and entrepreneurs; but then unhappily v. Kirchmann
dimly remembers the fact that production needs things
like raw materials and tools. So <i>Ort</i> is provided with raw
materials furtively introduced among the food, and with tools
among the furniture. But now the question arises: who is to get
these indigestible items in the course of general distribution?
the workers as wages, or the capitalists as profits of enterprise?
They could hardly expect a warm welcome from either. And on
such feeble premises the star turn of the performance is to take
place: the exchange between workers and entrepreneurs. The
fundamental transaction of exchange in capitalist production,
the exchange between workers and capitalists, is transformed by
v. Kirchmann from an exchange between living labour and
capital into an exchange of products. Not the first act, that of
exchanging labour power for variable capital, but the second,
the realisation of the wage received from the variable capital is
put at the centre of the whole machinery, the entire commodity
exchange of capitalist society being in turn reduced to this
realisation of the labour-wage. And the crowning glory is that
this exchange between workers and entrepreneurs, the king-pin
of all economic life, dissolves into nothing on a closer scrutiny&mdash;it
does not take place at all. For as soon as all workers have
received their natural wages in the form of half their product,
an exchange will be possible only among the workers themselves;
every worker will only keep one-third of his wage consisting
exclusively of either clothing, food or furniture, as the
case may be, and realise the remainder to equal parts in the
two other product-groups. The entrepreneurs no longer come
into this at all; the three of them are left high and dry with their
surplus value: half the clothing, furniture and food that has been
produced by the society; and they have no idea what to do with
the stuff. In this calamity of v. Kirchmann&#8217;s creation, even the
most generous distribution of the product would be of no use.
On the contrary, if larger quantities of the social product were
allotted to the workers, they would have even less to do with
the entrepreneurs in this transaction: all that would happen is
that the exchange of the workers among themselves would increase
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
in volume. The surplus product which the entrepreneurs
have on their hands would then contract, it is true, though not
indeed because the exchange of the surplus product would be
facilitated, but merely because there would be less surplus value
altogether. Now as before, an exchange of the social product
between workers and entrepreneurs is out of the question. One
must confess that the puerile and absurd economics here
crammed into comparatively little space exceed the bounds
even of what might be put up with from a Prussian Public
Prosecutor&mdash;such having been v. Kirchmann&#8217;s profession,
though he must be credited with having incurred disciplinary
censure on two occasions. Nevertheless, after these unpromising
preliminaries, v. Kirchmann goes right to the root of the matter.
He admits that his assuming the surplus product in a concrete
use-form is the reason why the surplus value cannot be usefully
employed. As a remedy he now allows the entrepreneurs to
devote half of the social labour appropriated as surplus value to
the production not of common goods but of luxuries. The
&#8216;essence of luxury-goods being that they enable the consumer to
use up more capital and labour power than in the case of
ordinary goods&#8217;, the three entrepreneurs manage to consume by
themselves in the form of laces, fashionable carriages and the
like, their entire half-share in all the labour performed by the
society. Now nothing unsaleable is left, and the crisis is happily
avoided; over-production is made impossible once and for all,
capitalists and workers alike are safe; the name of v. Kirchmann&#8217;s
magic cure which has brought all these benefits to pass,
and which re-establishes the balance between production and
consumption, being: luxury. In other words, the capitalists who
do not know what to do with their surplus value which they
cannot realise, are advised by the dear fellow&mdash;to eat it up! As
it happens, luxury is in fact an old familiar invention of capitalist
society, and still there are recurrent crises. Why is this?
v. Kirchmann enlightens us: &#8216;The answer can only be that in
real life sluggish markets are entirely due to the fact that there
are still <i>not enough</i> luxuries, or, in other words, that the capitalists,
i.e. those who can afford to consume, still consume too
little.&#8217;</p>

<p>This misguided abstinence of the capitalists, however, results
from a bad habit which political economists have been ill-advised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
to encourage: the desire to save for purposes of &#8216;productive
consumption&#8217;. In other words: crises are caused by
accumulation. This is v. Kirchmann&#8217;s principal thesis. He
proves it again by means of a touchingly simple example: &#8216;Let
us assume conditions which economists praise as more favourable,&#8217;
he says, &#8216;where the entrepreneurs say: we do not want to
spend our income to the last penny in splendour and luxury,
but will re-invest it productively. What does this mean? Nothing
but the setting-up of all sorts of productive enterprises for
delivering new goods of such a kind that their sale can yield
interest (v. Kirchmann means profits) on a capital saved and
invested by the three entrepreneurs from their unconsumed
revenues. Accordingly, the three entrepreneurs decide to consume
only the produce of a hundred workers, that is to say to
restrict their luxury considerably, and to employ the labour
power of the remaining 350 workers together with the capital
they use for setting up new productive enterprises. The question
now arises in what kind of productive enterprises these funds
are to be used.&#8217;</p>

<p>Since, according to v. Kirchmann&#8217;s assumption, constant
capital is not reproduced, and the entire social product consists
entirely of consumer goods, &#8216;the three entrepreneurs can only
choose again between enterprises for the manufacture of ordinary
goods or for that of luxuries&#8217;.</p>

<p>In this way, however, the three entrepreneurs will be faced
with the already familiar dilemma: if they turn out &#8216;common
goods&#8217;, there will be a crisis, since the workers lack means to
purchase these additional provisions, having been bought off
with half the value of their produce. If they go in for luxuries,
they will have to consume them alone. There is no other possibility.
The dilemma is not even affected by foreign trade which
would &#8216;only increase the range of commodities on the home
market&#8217; or increase productivity.</p>

<p>&#8216;These foreign commodities are therefore either common
goods&mdash;then the capitalist will not, and the worker, lacking the
means, cannot buy them, or they are luxuries, in which case the
worker, of course, is even less able to buy them, and the capitalist
will not want them either because of his efforts to save.&#8217;</p>

<p>This argument, however primitive, yet shows quite nicely and
clearly the fundamental conception of v. Kirchmann and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
nightmare of all economic theory: in a society consisting exclusively
of workers and capitalists, accumulation will be impossible.
v. Kirchmann is therefore frankly hostile to accumulation,
&#8216;saving&#8217;, &#8216;productive consumption&#8217; of the surplus value, and
strongly attacks these errors advocated by classical economics.
His gospel is increasing luxury together with the productivity of
labour as the specific against crises. We see that v. Kirchmann,
if he grotesquely aped Ricardo and Say in his theoretical
assumptions, is a caricature of Sismondi in his final conclusions.
Yet it is imperative to get v. Kirchmann&#8217;s approach to the
problem perfectly clear, if we are to understand the import of
Rodbertus&#8217; criticism and the outcome of the whole controversy.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XVI</i></h2>

<h2>RODBERTUS&#8217; CRITICISM
OF THE CLASSICAL SCHOOL</h2>

<p>Rodbertus digs deeper than v. Kirchmann. He looks for
the roots of evil in the very foundations of social organisation
and declares bitter war on the predominant Free
Trade school&mdash;not against a system of unrestricted commodity
circulation or the freedom of trade which he fully accepts, but
against the Manchester doctrine of <i>laissez-faire</i> within the internal
social relations of economy. At that time, after the period
of storm and stress of classical economics, a system of unscrupulous
apologetics was already in full sway which found its most
perfect expression in the &#8216;doctrine of harmony&#8217; of M. Frédéric
Bastiat, the famous vulgarian and idol of all Philistines, and
quite soon the various Schultzes were to flourish as commonplace,
German imitations of the French prophet of harmony.
Rodbertus&#8217; strictures are aimed at these unscrupulous &#8216;peddlers
of free trade&#8217;. In his first <i>Letter on Social Problems</i><a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>  he exclaims:</p>

<p>&#8216;Because of their paltry incomes, five-sixths of the population
are not only deprived of most of the benefits of civilisation, but
are in constant danger of the most terrible outbreaks of real distress
to which they sometimes succumb. Yet they are the
creators of all the wealth of the society. Their labours begin at
dawn and end at dusk, continuing even after night has fallen&mdash;but
no exertion can change this fate; they cannot raise their
income, and only lose that little leisure which ought to remain
nowadays for the improvement of their minds. Hitherto it might
have seemed as if all this suffering were necessary to the progress
of civilisation, but now that a series of the most wonderful discoveries
and inventions have increased human labour power
more than a hundredfold, new prospects of changing these grim
conditions are suddenly revealed. As a result, the wealth and
assets of a nation increase at a growing rate as compared with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
the population. Could anything be more natural, I ask, or more
justly demanded, than that this increase should also somehow
benefit the creators of this old and new wealth? that their
incomes should be raised or their working-hours shortened, or
that they might join in increasing numbers the ranks of the
lucky ones, privileged to reap the fruits of labour? Yet state
economy, or better, national economy has only achieved the
opposite result. Increasing poverty of these classes goes together
with increasing wealth of the nation, there is even need of
special legislation, lest the working day become longer, and
finally, the working classes swell in number out of proportion
with the others. Even that is not enough! The hundredfold
increase of labour efficiency which was powerless to relieve five-sixths
of the population, even threatens periodically the remaining
sixth of the nation and thus society as a whole.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What contradictions in the economic sphere in particular!
And what contradictions in the social sphere in general! The
wealth of society is growing, and this growth is accompanied
by a growth of poverty.&mdash;The creative efficiency of the means
of production is increasing, and the consequence is that they are
scrapped. Social conditions demand that the material position
of the working classes should be raised to the level of their
political status, and economic conditions, by way of answer,
depress them further. Society needs the unrestricted growth of
wealth, and contemporary leaders of production must create
restrictions, in order to discourage poverty. In a single respect
alone is there harmony: just as wrong as the conditions is the
authoritative section of the society with its inclination to look
for the root of the evil everywhere except in the right place.
This egotism, which only too often dons the scholar&#8217;s gown, also
accuses the vices of the workers of being the cause of poverty.
The responsibility for the crimes committed against them by
all-powerful facts is ascribed to their alleged discontent and
shiftlessness, and where even such egotism cannot close its eyes
to their innocence, it makes an elaborate dogma of the &#8220;necessity
of poverty&#8221;. Unremittingly, it exhorts the workers only to
work and to pray, impresses upon them the duty of abstinence
and economy, and at best infringes upon their rights by the
institution of compulsory saving, adding to the misery of the
workers. It does not see that a blind force of commerce has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
transformed the prayer for work into the curse of enforced
unemployment, that ... abstinence is impossible or cruel, and
that, lastly, morals always remain ineffective if commended by
those of whom the poet says that they drink wine in secret but
preach water in public.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>Thirty years after Sismondi and Owen, twenty years after
the indictment made by the English socialists, the followers
of Ricardo, and last but not least, after the publication of the
Communist Manifesto, such bold words alone cannot claim
to break new ground. What matters above all now is the
theoretical foundation of this indictment. Rodbertus here proposed
a complete system which can be reduced to the following
simple statements.</p>

<p>Owing to the laws of an economy left to its own devices, the
high level of labour productivity achieved by history, together
with the institutions of positive law, that is to say the right of
private ownership, a whole series of wrong and unethical
phenomena had emerged:</p>

<p>(1) In the place of &#8216;normal&#8217;, &#8216;constituted&#8217; value we have
exchange value, and accordingly coined money instead of a
proper &#8216;paper&#8217; or &#8216;labour&#8217; currency which would genuinely
correspond to the concept of money. The first principle is that
all economic goods are products of labour, or, as we might put
it, that labour alone is creative. This statement, however, does
not imply that the value of the product must always equal the
cost of labour, or that, in other words, value is even now
measured in terms of labour. The truth is rather &#8216;that this still
has not become a <i>fact</i>, but is only an <i>idea</i> of political economy&#8217;.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>&#8216;If the value could be constituted in accordance with the
labour expended on the product, we might imagine a kind of
money which would be, as it were, a leaf torn from the public
account-book, a receipt written on the most rubbishy material,
on rags, which everyone would receive for the value he has
produced, and which he would realise as a voucher for an
equivalent part of the national product subsequently under
distribution.... If, however, for some reason or another, it is
<i>impossible</i> or <i>not yet possible</i> to establish this value, money as such
must still retain the value it is designed to liquidate; made of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
an intrinsically valuable commodity like gold or silver, it has
to represent a pledge or pawn of the same value.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>  &#8216;As soon as
capitalist commodity production has come into existence, everything
is turned upside down: there can no longer be a constituted
value, since it can only be exchange value&#8217;,<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>  and, &#8216;since
the value cannot be constituted, money cannot be <i>purely</i> money,
it cannot fully conform to its concept&#8217;.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>  In an equitable exchange,
the exchange value of the products would have to equal
the quantity of labour needed for producing them, and an
exchange of products would always mean an exchange of equal
quantities of labour. Even assuming, however, that everybody
produced just those use-values which another person requires,
yet, &#8216;since we are here concerned with human discernment and
human volition, there must always be for a start a correct
calculation, adjustment and allocation of the labour quantities
contained in the products for exchange, there must be a <i>law</i>
to which the facts will conform&#8217;.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>It is well-known that Rodbertus, in his discovery of &#8216;constituted
value&#8217;, laid great stress on his priority to Proudhon
which we shall gladly concede him. Marx, in his <i>Poverty of
Philosophy</i>, and Engels in his preface to it, have comprehensively
shown that this &#8216;concept&#8217; is a mere phantom, still used in theory
but in practice buried already in England well before Rodbertus&#8217;
time, that it is but a Utopian distortion of Ricardo&#8217;s doctrine of
value. We therefore need not deal further with this &#8216;music of
the future, performed on a toy trumpet&#8217;.</p>

<p>(2) The &#8216;economy of exchange&#8217; resulted in the &#8216;degradation&#8217;
of labour to a commodity, the labour wage being determined
as an item of expenditure (<i>Eichmann&#8217;s der Arbeit</i>) instead of representing
a fixed rate of the national product. By a daring jump in
history, Rodbertus derives his wages law indirectly from slavery
and regards the specific traits which a capitalist production of
commodities imposes on exploitation as no more than a lying
deception against which he fulminates from a moral point of
view.</p>

<p>&#8216;So long as the producers themselves remained the property
of those who were not producing, so long as slavery was in
existence, it was the advantage of the &#8220;masters&#8221; alone which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
unilaterally determined the volume of this share (of the workers).
With the producers attaining full liberty of person, if nothing
more as yet, both parties agree on the wage in advance. The
wage, in modern terminology, is the object of a &#8220;free contract&#8221;,
that is to say, an object of competition. Labour is therefore as a
matter of course subjected to the same laws of exchange as its
products: labour itself acquires exchange value; the size of the
wage depends on the effects of supply and demand.&#8217;</p>

<p>Rodbertus, after having thus turned everything upside down,
after deriving the exchange value of labour from competition,
now immediately derives its value from its exchange value.</p>

<p>&#8216;Under the laws of exchange value, labour, like produced
goods, comes to have a kind of &#8220;cost value&#8221; which exercises
some magnetic effects upon its exchange value, the amount of
the labour wage. It is that particular amount of payment which
is necessary for the &#8220;maintenance&#8221; of labour, in other words,
which enables labour to continue, if only in the persons of its
progeny&mdash;it is the so-called &#8220;minimum of subsistence&#8221;.&#8217;</p>

<p>For Rodbertus, however, this is not a statement of objective
economic laws, but merely an object for moral indignation.
He calls the thesis of the classical school, that labour is worth
no more than the wages it can command, a &#8216;cynical&#8217; statement,
and he is determined to expose the &#8216;string of lies&#8217; leading to this
&#8216;crude and unethical&#8217; conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>&#8216;It was a degrading view to estimate the wages of labour in
accordance with the &#8220;necessary subsistence&#8221;, like so many
machines to be kept in repair. Now that labour, the fountainhead
of all commodities, has itself become a commodity of
exchange, it is no less degrading to speak of its &#8220;natural price&#8221;,
of its &#8220;costs&#8220;, just as we speak of the natural price and costs of
its product, and to include this natural price, these costs, in the
amount of goods that is necessary to call forth a continuous flow
of labour on the market.&#8217;</p>

<p>This commodity character of labour power, however, and the
corresponding determination of its value, are nothing but a
malicious misrepresentation of the Free Trade school. Like the
good Prussian he was, Rodbertus put capitalist commodity production
as a whole in the dock, as offending against the obtaining
constitutional law, instead of pointing out its inherent contradiction,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
the conflict between determining the value of labour
and determining the value <i>created by</i> labour, as the English
disciples of Ricardo had done.</p>

<p>&#8216;Stupid beyond words&#8217;, he exclaims, &#8216;is the dualist conception
of those economists who would have the workers, as far
as their legal status is concerned, join in deciding the fate of
society, and would for all that, have these same workers from an
economic point of view, always treated as mere commodities!&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>Now it only remains to find out why the workers put up with
such stupid and blatant injustice&mdash;an objection which Hermann
for instance raised against Ricardo&#8217;s theory of value. Rodbertus
is ready with this answer:</p>

<p>&#8216;What were the workers to do after their emancipation other
than to agree to these regulations? Imagine their position: when
the workers were freed, they were naked or in rags, they had
nothing but their labour power. The abolition of slavery or
serfdom, moreover, rescinded the master&#8217;s legal or moral obligation
to feed them and care for their needs. Yet these needs
remained, they still had to live. How, then, could their labour
power provide them with a living? Were they simply to grab
some of the capital existing in the society for their maintenance?
The capital of society was already in the hands of other people,
and the organs of the &#8220;law&#8221; would not have tolerated such a
step. What, then, could the workers have done? Only these
alternatives were before them: either to overthrow the law of
society or to return, under roughly the same conditions as
before, to their former masters, the owners of the land and of
capital, and to receive as wages what was formerly doled out to
them to keep them fed.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>It was fortunate for mankind and the Prussian state that the
workers were &#8216;wise&#8217; enough not to overthrow civilisation and
preferred to submit to the &#8216;base demands&#8217; of their &#8216;former
masters&#8217;. This, then, is the origin of the capitalist wage system,
of the wages law as &#8216;a kind of slavery&#8217; resulting from an abuse
of power on the part of the capitalists, and from the precarious
position and the meek acquiescence on the part of the proletariat&mdash;if
we are to believe the highly original explanations of
that very Rodbertus whose theories Marx is reputed to have
&#8216;plagiarised&#8217;. Let Rodbertus claim &#8216;priority&#8217; in this particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
theory of value without challenge, seeing that English socialists
and other social critics had already given far less crude and
primitive analyses of the wage-system. The singular point about
it all is that Rodbertus&#8217; display of moral indignation about the
origin and the economic laws of the wages system does not lead
up to the demand for doing away with this abominable injustice,
the &#8216;dualism stupid beyond words&#8217;. Far from it! He frequently
reassures his fellow-men that he does not really mean
anything very serious by roaring&mdash;he is no lion fell, only one
Snug the joiner. Indeed, an ethical theory of the wages law is
necessary only to achieve a further conclusion:</p>

<p>(3) Since the &#8216;laws of exchange value&#8217; determine the wage, an
advance in labour productivity must bring about an ever declining
share in the product for the workers. Here we have arrived
at the Archimedean fulcrum of Rodbertus&#8217; system. This &#8216;declining
wage rate&#8217; is his most important &#8216;original&#8217; discovery on
which he harps from his first writings on social problems (probably
in 1839) until his death, and which he &#8216;claims&#8217; as his very
own. This conception, for all that, was but a simple corollary of
Ricardo&#8217;s theory of value and is contained implicit in the wages
fund theory which dominated bourgeois economics up to the
publication of Marx&#8217;s <i>Capital</i>. Rodbertus nevertheless believed
that this &#8216;discovery&#8217; made him a kind of Galileo in economics,
and he refers to his &#8216;declining wage rate&#8217; as explaining every
evil and contradiction in capitalist economy. Above all, he
derives from the declining wage rate the phenomenon of
pauperism which, together with the crises, in his opinion constitutes
the social question. It would be as well to draw the
attention of contemporaries, &#8216;out for Marx&#8217;s blood&#8217;, to the fact
that it was not Marx but Rodbertus, a man much nearer their
own heart, who set up a whole theory of progressive poverty in
a very crude form, and that he, unlike Marx, made it the very
pivot, not just a symptom, of the entire social problem. Compare
for instance his argument in his first <i>Letter on Social Problems</i>
to v. Kirchmann on the absolute impoverishment of the
working class. The &#8216;declining wage rate&#8217; must serve in addition
to explain the other fundamental phenomena of the social
problem&mdash;the crises. In this connection Rodbertus tackles the
problem of balancing consumption with production, touching
upon the whole lot of cognate controversial issues which had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
already been fought out between the schools of Sismondi and
Ricardo.</p>

<p>Rodbertus&#8217; knowledge of crises was of course based upon far
more material evidence than that of Sismondi. In his first <i>Letter
on Social Problems</i> he already gives a detailed description of the
four crises in 1818-19, 1825, 1837-9 and 1847. Since his observations
covered a much longer period, Rodbertus could by and
large gain a much deeper insight into the essential character of
crises than his predecessors. As early as 1850 he formulated
the periodical character of the crises which recur at ever
shorter intervals and at the same time with ever increasing
severity:</p>

<p>&#8216;Time after time, these crises have become more terrible in
proportion with the increase in wealth, engulfing an ever greater
number of victims. The crisis of 1818-19, although even this
caused panic in commerce and inspired misgivings in economics,
was of small importance compared to that of 1825-6. The first
crisis had made such inroads on the capital assets of England
that the most famous economists doubted whether complete
recovery could ever be made. Yet it was eclipsed by the crisis of
1836-7. The crises of 1839-40 and 1846-7 wrought even greater
havoc than previous ones.&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;According to recent experiences,
however, the crises recur at ever shorter intervals. There was a
lapse of 18 years between the first and the third crisis, of
14 years between the second and the fourth, and of only
12 years between the third and the fifth. Already the signs are
multiplying that a new disaster is imminent, though no doubt
the events of 1848 put off the catastrophe.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>Rodbertus remarks that an extraordinary boom in production
and great progress in industrial technique always are the
heralds of a crisis. &#8216;Every one of them [of the crises] followed
upon a period of outstanding industrial prosperity.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>From the crises in history he demonstrates that &#8216;they occur
only after a considerable increase of productivity&#8217;.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>  Rodbertus
opposes what he terms the vulgar view which conceives of crises
as mere disturbances in the monetary and credit system, and
he criticises the whole of Peel&#8217;s currency legislation as an error
of judgment, arguing the point in detail in his essay <i>On
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
Commercial Crises and the Mortgage Problem</i>. There he makes the
following comment among others: &#8216;We would therefore deceive
ourselves if we were to regard commercial crises merely as crises
of the monetary, banking, or credit system. This is only their
outer semblance when they first emerge.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>Rodbertus also shows a remarkably acute grasp of the part
played by foreign trade in the problem of crises. Just like
Sismondi, he states the necessity of expansion for capitalist production,
but he simultaneously emphasises the fact that the
periodical crises are bound to grow in volume.</p>

<p>&#8216;Foreign trade&#8217;, he says, &#8216;is related to slumps only as charity is
related to poverty. They ultimately only enhance one another.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
And further: &#8216;The only possible means of warding off further
outbreaks of crises is the application of the two-edged knife of
expanding foreign markets. The violent urge towards such expansion
is largely no more but a morbid irritation caused by a
sickly organ. Since one factor on the home market, productivity,
is ever increasing, and the other factor, purchasing power,
remains constant for the overwhelming majority of the population,
commerce must endeavour to conjure up a similarly
unlimited amount of purchasing power on the foreign market.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
In this way, the irritation may be soothed to some extent so
that at least there will not be a new outbreak of the calamity
right away. Every foreign market opened defers the social problem
in a like manner. Colonisation of primitive countries would
have similar effects: Europe rears a market for herself in places
where none had been before. Yet such a medicine would essentially
do no more than appease the ill. As soon as the new
markets are supplied, the problem will revert to its former state&mdash;a
conflict between the two factors: limited purchasing power
versus unlimited productivity. The new attack would be warded
off the small market only to re-appear, in even wider dimensions
and with even more violent incidents, on a larger one. And
since the earth is finite and the acquisition of new markets must
some time come to an end, the time will come when the question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
can no longer be simply adjourned. Sooner or later, a
definite solution will have to be found.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
Rodbertus also recognises the anarchical character of capitalist
private enterprise to be conducive to crises, but only as one
factor among many, seeing it as the source of a particular type
of crises, not as the real cause of crises in general. About the
crises at v. Kirchmann&#8217;s <i>Ort</i>, e.g., he says: &#8216;I maintain that a
slump of this kind does not occur in real life. The market of
to-day is large, there are countless wants and many branches of
production, productivity is considerable and the data of commerce
are obscure and misleading. The individual entrepreneur
does not know how much others are producing, and so it may
easily happen that he over-estimates the demand for a certain
commodity with which he will then overstock the market.&#8217;</p>

<p>Rodbertus says outright that the only remedy for these crises
is the &#8216;complete reversal&#8217; of contemporary property-relations or
a planned economy, concentrating all means of production &#8216;in
the hands of a single social authority&#8217;. To set troubled minds at
rest, however, he is quick to add that he reserves judgment as
to whether there can actually be such a state of affairs&mdash;&#8216;yet
this would be the only possible way to prevent slumps of this
kind&#8217;. Thus he expressly regards anarchy in the modern mode
of production as responsible for only a specific and partial
manifestation of crises.</p>

<p>Rodbertus scornfully rejects Say-Ricardo&#8217;s axiom of a natural
equilibrium between consumption and production; just like
Sismondi, he emphasises that everything turns on the purchasing
power of society, and also takes it to be dependent upon
the distribution of income. All the same, he does not endorse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
Sismondi&#8217;s theory of crises and disagrees sharply with the conclusions
drawn from it. If Sismondi saw the source of all evil in
the unlimited expansion of production without regard to the
limitations of incomes, and advocated a restriction of production,
Rodbertus, quite on the contrary, champions the most
powerful and unrestricted expansion of production, of wealth
and of the productive forces, believing this to be a social necessity.
Whoever rejects the wealth of society, rejects at the same
time its power, its progress, and, with its progress, its virtues.
Whoever stands in the way of growing wealth, stands in the
way of all social progress whatever. Every increase in knowledge,
resolve and capacity is conceived as bound up with an
increase in wealth.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>  From this point of view, Rodbertus is
strongly in favour of issuing houses which he regards as the
indispensable foundations for a rapid and unrestricted expansion
of company promoting. Both his essay of 1859 on the
mortgage problem and the treatise on the <i>Financial Crisis in
Prussia</i><a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>  are devoted to this plea. He even polemises outright
against the Sismondian type of <i>caveat</i>, as usual broaching the
matter first from his peculiar Utopian ethics.</p>

<p>&#8216;The entrepreneurs&#8217;, he holds forth, &#8216;are essentially civil servants
of economy. By the institution of property, they are once
and for all entrusted with the nation&#8217;s means of production. If
they set them to work and strain all their energies in the process,
they do but their duty, since capital&mdash;let me repeat&mdash;exists
entirely for the sake of production.&#8217; And a further, factual
argument: &#8216;Or would you have them (the entrepreneurs) turn
acute attacks of suffering into a chronic state by working persistently
and from the first with fewer forces than are given by
the means of production; are they to pay for a less severe form
of the evil with its permanent duration? Even if we were silly
enough to give them this advice, they would not be able to
follow it. How could the entrepreneurs of the world recognise
the limits beyond which the market would cease to be healthy?
They engage in production without knowing the one of the
other, they are producing in the most distant corners of the
earth for a market hundreds of miles away, they produce with
such vast forces that a month&#8217;s production may already overstep
the limit. How could production&mdash;so divided and yet so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
powerful&mdash;conceivably estimate in good time what will be
enough? Where, for instance, are the organisations, the up-to-date
statistical bureaux and the like to help them in this task?
What is worse, the price alone, its rise and fall, indicates the
position of the market, and this is not like a barometer which
predicts the temperature of the market, but more like a thermometer
which only registers it. If the price falls, the limit has
been passed already, and the evil is with us.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>These thrusts, obviously aimed at Sismondi, exhibit quite
fundamental differences between the two opponents. If Engels
then says in his <i>Anti-Duehring</i> that Sismondi first explained the
crises as resulting from under-consumption, and that Rodbertus
borrowed this view from him, he is not strictly accurate. All
that Rodbertus and Sismondi have in common is their opposition
against the classical school and the general explanation of
crises as the result of the distribution of incomes. Even in this
connection Rodbertus mounts his own particular hobby horse:
over-production is not caused by the low level of working class
incomes, nor yet, as Sismondi maintains, by the capitalists&#8217;
limited capacity for consumption, but solely by the fact that
with a growing productivity of labour, the workers&#8217; income, in
terms of value, represents an ever smaller share of the product.
Rodbertus takes pains to convince the opposition that it is not
the small volume of the workers&#8217; share which causes the crises.</p>

<p>&#8216;Just imagine&#8217;, he goes on to lecture v. Kirchmann, &#8216;these
shares to be so small as to ensure only a bare subsistence for
those who are entitled to them. As long as you establish them as
representing a proportion of the national product, you will have
a constant &#8220;vessel for value&#8221; which can absorb ever increasing
contents, and an ever increasing prosperity of the working
classes as well.... And now imagine on the contrary as large a
share for the working classes as you please, and let it become an
ever smaller fraction of the national product that grows with
increasing productivity. Then, provided it is not reduced to the
present pittance, this share will still protect the workers from
undue privations since the amount of products it represents will
still be considerably greater than it is to-day. Once this share
begins to decline, however, there will be spreading discontent,
culminating in a commercial crisis for which the capitalists are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
not to blame inasmuch as they did no more than their duty
in laying down the volume of production according to the given
magnitude of these shares.&#8217;</p>

<p>That is why the &#8216;declining wage rate&#8217; is the real cause of
crises. It can only be counteracted by legal measures to ensure
that the workers&#8217; share represents a stable and unchanging rate
of the national product. This grotesque notion takes some understanding
if we are to do justice to its economic implications.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XVII</i></h2>

<h2>RODBERTUS&#8217; ANALYSIS OF
REPRODUCTION</h2>

<p>To begin with, what does it mean that a decrease in the
workers&#8217; share is bound immediately to engender over-production
and commercial crises? Such a view can only
make sense provided Rodbertus takes the &#8216;national product&#8217; to
consist of two parts, <i>vide</i> the shares of the workers and of the
capitalists, in short of <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>, one share being exchangeable for the
other. And that is more or less what he actually seems to say on
occasions, e.g. in his first <i>Letter on Social Problems</i>:</p>

<p>&#8216;The poverty of the working classes precludes their income
from giving scope to increasing production. The additional
amount of products from the entrepreneurs&#8217; point of view lowers
the value of the aggregate product so far as to bar production
on the former scale, leaving the workers at best to their accustomed
straits, though, if it could be made available to the
workers, it would not only improve their lot but would further
act as a counterweight by increasing the value of what is retained
by the capitalists (and so enable the latter to keep their
enterprises at the same level).&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>The &#8216;counterweight&#8217; which in the hand of the workers increases
the &#8216;value&#8217; of &#8216;what is retained&#8217; by the entrepreneurs,
can in this context only be the demand. Once again, we have
landed happily at the familiar <i>Ort</i> of v. Kirchmann&#8217;s where
workers and capitalists exchange their incomes for the surplus
product, and where the crises arise because variable capital is
small and the surplus value large. This peculiar notion has
already been dealt with above. There are other occasions, however,
when Rodbertus advances a somewhat different conception.
The interpretation of his theory in the fourth <i>Letter on
Social Problems</i> is that the continual shifts in the relations of
demand, evident in the share of the working class and caused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
by the share of the capitalist class, must result in a chronic disproportion
between production and consumption.</p>

<p>&#8216;What if the entrepreneurs endeavour to keep always within
the limits of those shares, yet the shares themselves are all the
time on the decline for the great majority of the society, the
workers, decreasing gradually, unnoticeably, but with relentless
force?&mdash;What if the share of these classes is continually decreasing
to the same extent as their productivity is increasing?&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;Is it
not really the fact that the capitalists of necessity organise production
in accordance with the present volume of shares in
order to make wealth universal, and that yet they always produce
over and above this volume (of previous shares), thereby
perpetuating dissatisfaction which culminates in this stagnation
of trade?&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>On this showing, the explanation of crises should be as
follows: the national product consists of a number of &#8216;common
goods&#8217;, as v. Kirchmann puts it, for the workers, and of superior
goods for the capitalists. The wages represent the quantity of
the former, and aggregate surplus value that of the latter. If the
capitalists organise their production on this footing, and if at the
same time there is progressive productivity, a lack of proportion
will immediately ensue. For the share of the workers to-day is
no longer that of yesterday, but less. If the demand for &#8216;common
goods&#8217; had involved, say, six-sevenths of the national product
yesterday, then to-day it involves only five-sevenths, and the
entrepreneurs, having provided for six-sevenths of &#8216;common
goods&#8217;, will find to their painful surprise that they over-produced
by one-seventh. Now, wiser by this experience, they
try to organise to-morrow&#8217;s output of &#8216;common goods&#8217; to a mere
five-sevenths of the total value of the national product, but they
have a new disappointment coming to them, since the share of
the national product falling to wages to-morrow is bound to be
only four-sevenths, and so on.</p>

<p>In this ingenious theory there are quite a few points to make
us wonder. If our commercial crises are entirely due to the fact
that the workers&#8217; &#8216;wage rate&#8217;, the variable capital, represents a
constantly diminishing portion of the total value of the national
product, then this unfortunate law brings with it the cure for the
evil it has caused, since it must be an ever smaller part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
aggregate product for which there is over-production. Although
Rodbertus delights in such terms as &#8216;an overwhelming majority&#8217;,
&#8216;the large popular masses&#8217; of consumers, it is not the number of
heads that make up the demand, but the value they represent
which is relevant. This value, if Rodbertus is to be believed,
forms a more and more trifling part of the aggregate product.
Crises are thus made to rest on an ever narrowing economic
basis, and all that remains to discover is how in spite of it all it
can still happen that the crises are universal and increasingly
severe besides, as Rodbertus is fully aware. The purchasing
power lost by the working classes should be gained by the
capitalist class; if <i>v</i> decreases, <i>s</i> must grow larger to make up for
it. On this crude scheme, the purchasing power of society as a
whole cannot change, as Rodbertus says in so many words: &#8216;I
know very well that what is taken from the workers&#8217; share goes
ultimately to swell that of the &#8220;rentiers&#8221; (rent and surplus value
are used as synonyms, <i>R.L.</i>), and that purchasing power remains
constant on the whole and in the long run. But as far as
the product on the market is concerned, the crisis always sets in
before this increase can make itself felt.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>In short, the most it can amount to is that there is &#8216;too much&#8217;
of &#8216;common goods&#8217; and &#8216;too little&#8217; of superior goods for the
capitalists. Quite unawares, and by devious ways, Rodbertus
here falls in with the Say-Ricardian theory he so ardently contested,
the theory that over-production on one side always
corresponds to under-production on the other. Seeing that the
ratio of the two shares is persistently shifting to the advantage of
the capitalists, our commercial crises might be expected on the
whole to take on increasingly the character of periodical under-
instead of over-production! Enough of this exercise in logic.
The upshot of it all is that Rodbertus conceives the national
product in respect of its value as made up of two parts only, of
<i>s</i> and <i>v</i>, thus wholly subscribing to the views and traditions of the
classical school he is fighting tooth and nail, and even adding
his own flourish that the capitalists consume the entire surplus
value. That is why he repeatedly says without mincing his
words, as in the fourth <i>Letter on Social Problems</i>:</p>

<p>&#8216;Accordingly, we must abstract from the reasons which cause
the division of rent in general into rent proper and capital rent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
to find the basic principle underlying the division of rent (surplus
value) in general, the principle underlying <i>the division of the
labour product into wage and rent</i>.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>  And, in the third <i>Letter</i>:
&#8216;Ground rent, capital profit and the wage of labour are, let me
repeat, revenue. By this means landlords, capitalists and workers
must live, must satisfy, that is to say, their immediate human
necessities. They must therefore draw their income in the form
of goods suitable for this purpose.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>The misrepresentation of capitalist economy has never been
formulated more crudely, and there is no doubt that Rodbertus
claims the palm of &#8216;priority&#8217;&mdash;not so much over Marx as over
all popular economists&mdash;with full justification. To leave the
reader in no doubt about the utter muddle he has made, he
goes on, in the same letter, to rank capitalist surplus value as an
economic category on the same level as the revenue of the
ancient slave-owner:</p>

<p>&#8216;The first state (that of slavery) goes with the most primitive
natural economy: that portion of the labour product which is
withheld from the income of workers or slaves and forms the
master&#8217;s or owner&#8217;s property, will undividedly accrue to the one
man who owns the land, the capital, the worker and the labour
product; there is not even a distinction of thought between rent
and capital profits.&mdash;The second state entails the most complicated
money economy: that portion of the labour product,
withheld from the income of the now emancipated workers, and
accruing to the respective owners of land, and capital, will be
further divided among the owners of the raw material and the
manufactured product respectively; the one rent of the former
state will be split up into ground rent and capital profits, and
will have to be differentiated accordingly.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>Rodbertus regards the splitting-up of the surplus value &#8216;withheld&#8217;
from the workers&#8217; &#8216;income&#8217; as the most striking difference
between exploitation by slavery and modern capitalist exploitation.
It is not the specific historical form of sharing out newly
created value among labour and capital, but the distribution of
the surplus value among the various people it benefits, which,
irrelevant to the productive process, is yet the decisive fact in the
capitalist mode of production. In all other respects, capitalist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
surplus value remains just the same as the old &#8216;single rent&#8217;
of the slave-owner: a private fund for the exploiter&#8217;s own consumption!</p>

<p>Yet Rodbertus again contradicts himself in other places, remembering
all of a sudden the constant capital and the necessity
for its renewal in the reproductive process. Thus, instead of
bisecting the aggregate product into <i>v</i> and <i>s</i>, he posits a triple
division: <i>c</i>, <i>v</i>, and <i>s</i>. In his third <i>Letter on Social Problems</i> he argues
on the forms of reproduction in a slave-economy:</p>

<p>&#8216;Since the master will see to it that part of the slave labour is
employed in maintaining or even improving the fields, herds,
agricultural and manufacturing tools, there will be &#8220;capital
replacement&#8221;, to use a modern term, in which part of the
national economic product is immediately used for the upkeep
of the estate, without any mediation by exchange or even by
exchange value.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>  And, passing on to capitalist reproduction,
he continues: &#8216;Now, in terms of value, one portion of the labour
product, is used or set aside for the maintenance of the estate,
for &#8220;capital replacement&#8221;, another, for the workers&#8217; subsistence
as their money wage; and the owners of the land, of capital,
and of the labour product retain the last as their revenue
or rent.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>This, then, is an explicit expression of the triple division into
constant capital, variable capital, and surplus value. Again, in
this third <i>Letter</i>, he formulates the peculiarity of his &#8216;new&#8217; theory
with equal precision: &#8216;On this theory, then, and under conditions
of adequate labour productivity, the portion of the product
which remains for wages after the replacement of capital,
will be distributed among workers and owners as wages and
rent, on the basis of the ownership in land and capital.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>It does seem now as if Rodbertus&#8217; analysis of the value of the
aggregate product represents a distinct advance over the classical
school. Even Adam Smith&#8217;s &#8216;dogma&#8217; is openly criticised a little
further on, and it is really surprising that Rodbertus&#8217; learned
admirers, Messrs. Wagner, Dietzel, Diehl &amp; Co. failed to claim
their white-headed boy&#8217;s &#8216;priority&#8217; over Marx on such an important
point of economic theory. As a matter of fact, in this
respect no less than in the general theory of value, Rodbertus&#8217;
priority is of a somewhat dubious character. If he seems on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
occasion to gain true insight, it immediately turns out to be a
misunderstanding, or at best a wrong approach. His criticism of
Adam Smith&#8217;s dogma affords a supreme example of his failure
to cope with the triple division of the national product towards
which he had groped his way. He says literally:</p>

<p>&#8216;You know that all economists since Adam Smith already
divided the value of the product into wage of labour, rent, and
capital profit, that it is therefore not a new idea to ground the
incomes of the various classes, and especially the various items
of the rent, in a division of the product. But the economists at
once go off the track. All of them, not even excepting Ricardo&#8217;s
school, make the mistake, first, not to recognise that the aggregate
product, the finished good, the national product as a whole,
is an entity in which workers, landowners, and capitalists all
share, but conceiving the division of the unfinished product to
be of one kind shared among three partners, and that of the
manufactured product as of another kind again, shared between
only two partners. For these theories both the unfinished product
and the manufactured product constitute as such separate
items of revenue. Secondly,&mdash;though both Sismondi and Ricardo
are free from this particular error&mdash;they regard the natural fact
that labour cannot produce goods without material help, i.e.
without the land, as an economic fact, and take the social fact
for a primary datum that capital as understood to-day is required
by the division of labour. Thus they set up the fiction of
a fundamental economic relationship on which they base also
for the shares of the various owners, ground rent springing from
the contribution of the land lent by the owner to production,
capital profits from the contribution of capital employed by the
capitalist to this end, and the wages finally from labour&#8217;s contribution,
seeing that there are separate owners of land, capital,
and labour in the society. Say&#8217;s school, elaborating on this
mistake with much ingenuity, even invented the concept of productive
service of land, capital, and labour in conformity with
the shares in the product of their respective owners, so as to
explain these shares as the result of productive service.&mdash;Thirdly,
they are caught up in the ultimate folly of deriving the wage of
labour and the items of rent from the value of the product, the
value of the product in turn being derived from the wage of
labour and the items of rent, so that the one is made to depend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
on the other and <i>vice versa</i>. This absurdity is quite unmistakable
when some of these authors attempt to expound &#8220;The
Influence of Rent Upon Production Prices&#8221; and &#8220;The Influence
of Production Prices Upon Rent&#8221; in two consecutive chapters.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>Yet for all these excellent critical comments&mdash;the last, particularly
acute, actually does to some extent anticipate Marx&#8217;s
criticism of this point in <i>Capital</i>, volume ii&mdash;Rodbertus calmly
falls in with the fundamental blunder of the classical school and
its vulgar followers: to ignore altogether that part of the value
of the aggregate product which is needed to replace the constant
capital of the society. This way it was easier for him to keep up
the singular fight against the &#8216;declining wage rate&#8217;.</p>

<p>Under capitalist forms of production, the value of the aggregate
social product is divided into three parts: one corresponding
to the value of the constant capital, the second to the wage total,
i.e. the variable capital, and the third to the aggregate surplus
value of the capitalist class. In this composition, the portion
corresponding to the variable capital is relatively on the decline,
and this for two reasons. To begin with, the relation of <i>c</i> to
(<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>) within <i>c</i>&nbsp;+ <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i> changes all the time in the direction of a
relative increase of <i>c</i> and a relative decrease of <i>v</i>+<i>s</i>. This is the
simple law for a progressive efficiency of human labour, valid
for all societies of economic progress, independently of their
historical forms, a formula which only states that living labour is
increasingly able to convert more means of production into
objects for use in an ever shorter time. And if (<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>) decreases as
a whole, so must <i>v</i>, as its part, decrease in relation to the total
value of the product. To kick against this, to try and stop the
decrease, would be tantamount to contending against the
general effects of a growing labour productivity. Further, there
is within (<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>) as well a change in the direction of a relative
decrease in <i>v</i> and a relative increase in <i>s</i>, that is to say, an ever
smaller part of the newly created value is spent on wages and an
ever greater part is appropriated as surplus value. This is the
specifically capitalist formula of progressive labour productivity
which, under capitalist conditions of production, is no less valid
than the general law. To use the power of the state to prevent a
decrease of <i>v</i> as against <i>s</i> would mean that the fundamental
commodity of labour power is debarred from this progress which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
decreases production costs for all commodities; it would mean
the exemption of this one commodity from the economic effects
of technical progress. More than that: the &#8216;declining wage rate&#8217;
is only another expression of the rising rate of surplus value
which forms the most powerful and effective means of checking
a decline of the profit rate, and which therefore represents the
prime incentive for capitalist production in general, and for
technical progress within this system of production in particular.
Doing away with the &#8216;declining wage rate&#8217; by way of legislation
would be as much as to do away with the <i>raison d&#8217;être</i> of capitalist
society, to deal a crippling blow to its entire system. Let us face
the facts: the individual capitalist, just like capitalist society as
a whole, has no glimmering that the value of the product is
made up from the sum total of labour necessary in the society,
and this is actually beyond his grasp. Value, as the capitalist
understands it, is the derivative form, reversed by competition
as production costs. While in truth the value of the product
is broken down into the values of its component fragments <i>c</i>, <i>v</i>
and <i>s</i>, the capitalist mind conceives of it as the summation of
<i>c</i>, <i>v</i> and <i>s</i>. These, in addition, also appear to him from a distorted
perspective and in a secondary form, as (1) the wear and
tear of his fixed capital, (2) his advances on circulating capital,
including workers&#8217; wages, and (3) the current profits, i.e. the
average rate of profit on his entire capital. How, then, is the
capitalist to be compelled by a law, say of the kind envisaged
by Rodbertus, to maintain a &#8216;fixed wage rate&#8217; in the face of the
aggregate value of the product? It would be quite as brilliant to
stipulate by law for exactly one-third, no more, no less, of the
total price of the product to be payable for the raw materials
employed in the manufacture of any commodity. Obviously,
Rodbertus&#8217; supreme notion, of which he was so proud, on which
he built as if it were a new Archimedean discovery, which was
to be the specific for all the ills of capitalist production, is arrant
nonsense from all aspects of the capitalist mode of production.
It could only result from the muddle in the theory of value
which is brought to a head in Rodbertus&#8217; inimitable phrase:
that &#8216;now, in a capitalist society, the product must have value-in-exchange
just as it had to have value-in-use in ancient
economy&#8217;.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>  People in ancient society had to eat bread and meat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
in order to live, but we of to-day are already satisfied with knowing
the price of bread and of meat. The most obvious inference
from Rodbertus&#8217; monomania about a &#8216;fixed wage rate&#8217; is that he
is quite incapable of understanding capitalist accumulation.</p>

<p>Previous quotations have already shown that Rodbertus
thinks solely of simple commodity production, quite in keeping
with his mistaken doctrine that the purpose of capitalist production
is the manufacture of consumer goods for the satisfaction of
&#8216;human wants&#8217;. For he always talks of &#8216;capital replacements&#8217;, of
the need to enable the capitalists to &#8216;continue their enterprise on
the previous scale&#8217;. His principal argument, however, is directly
opposed to the accumulation of capital. To fix the rate of the
surplus value, to prevent its growth, is tantamount to paralysing
the accumulation of capital. Both Sismondi and v. Kirchmann
had recognised the problem of balancing production and consumption
to be indeed a problem of accumulation, that is to
say of enlarged capitalist reproduction. Both traced the disturbances
in the equilibrium of reproduction to accumulative
tendencies denying the possibility of accumulation, with the
only difference that the one recommended a damper on the productive
forces as a remedy, while the other favoured their increasing
employment to produce luxuries, the entire surplus
value to be consumed. In this field, too, Rodbertus follows his
own solitary path. The others might try with more or less
success to comprehend the <i>fact</i> of capitalist accumulation, but
Rodbertus prefers to fight the very concept. &#8216;Economists since
Adam Smith have one after the other echoed the principle,
setting it up as a universal and absolute truth, that capital could
only come about by saving and accumulating.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>Rodbertus is up in arms against this &#8216;deluded judgment&#8217;.
Over sixty pages of print he sets out in detail that (<i>a</i>) it is not
saving which is the source of capital but labour, that (<i>b</i>) the
economists&#8217; &#8216;delusion&#8217; about &#8216;saving&#8217; hails from the extravagant
view that capital is itself productive, and that (<i>c</i>) this delusion is
ultimately due to another: the error that capital is&mdash;capital.</p>

<p>v. Kirchmann for his part understood quite well what is at the
bottom of capitalist &#8216;savings&#8217;. He had the pretty argument:
&#8216;Everyone knows that the accumulation of capital is not a mere
hoarding of reserves, an amassing of metal and monies to remain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
idle in the owners&#8217; vaults. Those who want to save do it for the
sake of re-employing their savings either personally or through
the agency of others as capital, in order to yield them revenue.
That is only possible if these capitals are used in new enterprises
which can produce so as to provide the required interest. One
may build a ship, another a barn, a third may reclaim a desolate
swamp, a fourth may order a new spinning frame, while a fifth,
in order to enlarge his shoe-making business, would buy more
leather and employ more hands&mdash;and so on. Only if the capital
that has been saved is employed in this way, can it yield interest
(meaning profit), and the latter is the ultimate object of all
saving.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>That is how v. Kirchmann described somewhat clumsily,
but on the whole correctly, what is in fact the capitalisation
of surplus value, the process of capitalist accumulation, which
constitutes the whole significance of saving, advocated by
classical economists &#8216;since Adam Smith&#8217; with unerring instinct.
Declaring war on saving and accumulation was quite in keeping
with v. Kirchmann&#8217;s premises, considering that he, like
Sismondi, saw the immediate cause of the crises in accumulation.
Here, too, Rodbertus is more &#8216;thorough&#8217;. Having learned
from Ricardo&#8217;s theory of value that labour is the source of all
value, and consequently of capital, too, he is completely blinded
by this elementary piece of knowledge to the entire complexity
of capitalist production and capital movements. Since capital is
generated by labour, both the accumulation of capital, i.e. &#8216;saving&#8217;,
and the capitalisation of the surplus value are nothing but
eyewash.</p>

<p>In order to untangle this intricate network of errors by
&#8216;economists since Adam Smith&#8217;, he takes, as we might expect,
the example of the &#8216;isolated husbandman&#8217; and proves all that he
needs by a long-drawn vivisection of the unhappy creature.
Here already he discovers &#8216;capital&#8217;, that is to say, of course, that
famous &#8216;original stick&#8217; with which &#8216;economists since Adam
Smith&#8217; have hooked the fruits of a theory of capital from the tree
of knowledge. &#8216;Would saving be able to produce this stick?&#8217; is
his query. And since every normal person will understand that
&#8216;saving&#8217; cannot produce any stick, that Robinson [Crusoe] must
have made it of wood, we have already proved that the &#8216;savings&#8217;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
theory is quite mistaken. Presently, the &#8216;isolated husbandman&#8217;
hooks a fruit from the tree with the stick, and this fruit is his
&#8216;income&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8216;If capital were the source of income, already this most
elementary and primitive event would have to give evidence of
this relation. Would it be true to say, then, without doing
violence to facts and concepts, that the stick is a <i>source</i> of income
or of part of the income consisting in the fruit brought down? can
we trace income, wholly or in part, back to the stick as its <i>cause</i>,
may we consider it, wholly or in parts, as a <i>product</i> of the stick?&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>Surely not. And since the fruit is the product, not of the stick
which brought it down, but of the tree which grew it, Rodbertus
has already proved that all &#8216;economists since Adam Smith&#8217; are
grossly mistaken if they maintain that income derives from
capital. After a clear exposition of all fundamental concepts of
economics on the example of Robinson [Crusoe]&#8217;s &#8216;economy&#8217;,
Rodbertus transfers the knowledge thus acquired first to a
fictitious society &#8216;without ownership in capital or land&#8217;, that is
to say to a society with a communist mode of possession, and
then to a society &#8216;with ownership in capital and land&#8217;, that is to
say contemporary society, and, lo and behold&mdash;all the laws of
Robinson [Crusoe]&#8217;s economy apply point for point to these two
forms of society as well. Rodbertus contrives here a theory of
capital and income which is the very crown of his Utopian
imagination. Since he has discovered that Robinson [Crusoe]&#8217;s
&#8216;capital&#8217; is the means of production pure and simple, he identifies
capital with the means of production in capitalist economy as
well. Thus reducing capital, with a wave of his hand, to constant
capital, he protests in the name of justice and morality against
the fact that the wages, the workers&#8217; means of subsistence, are
also considered capital. He contends furiously against the <i>concept</i>
of variable capital, seeing in it the cause of every disaster.
&#8216;If only&#8217;, he grieves, &#8216;economists would pay attention to what I
say, if only they would examine without prejudice whether they
are right or I. This is the focal point of all errors about capital
in the ruling system, this is the ultimate source of injustice
against the working classes, in theory and practice alike.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
For &#8216;justice&#8217; demands that the goods constituting the &#8216;real
wages&#8217; of the workers be counted, not as part of capital, but as
belonging to the category of income. Though Rodbertus knows
very well that the capitalist must regard the wages he has
&#8216;advanced&#8217; as part of his capital, just like the other part laid
out on immediate means of production, yet in his opinion this
applies only to individual capitals. As soon as it is a question of
the social aggregate product, of reproduction as a whole, he
declares the capitalist categories of production an illusion, a
malicious lie and a &#8216;wrong&#8217;. &#8216;Capital <i>per se</i> (properly so-called),
the items which make up capital, capital from the nation&#8217;s point
of view, is something quite different from private capital, capital
<i>assets</i>, capital <i>property</i>, all that &#8220;capital&#8221; in the modern use of the
term usually stands for.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>An individual capitalist produces by capitalist methods, but
society as a whole must produce like Robinson [Crusoe], as a
collective owner employing communist methods.</p>

<p>&#8216;It makes no difference from this general and national point
of view that greater or smaller parts of the aggregate national
product are now owned in all the various phases of production
by private persons who must not be numbered among the producers
proper, and that the latter always manufacture this
national aggregate product as servants&mdash;without sharing in the
ownership of their own product&mdash;of these few owners.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
Certain peculiarities of the relations within the society as a
whole no doubt result from this, namely (1) the institution of
&#8216;exchange&#8217; as an intermediary, and (2) the inequality in the
distribution of the product.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yet all these consequences do not affect the movements of
national production and the shaping of the national product
which are always the same, now as ever (under the rule of communism),
no more than they alter in any respect, as far as the
<i>national point of view</i> is concerned, the contrast between capital
and income so far established.&#8217;</p>

<p>Sismondi had laboured in the sweat of his brow, as had Smith
and many others, to disentangle the concepts of capital and
income from the contradictions of capitalist production. Rodbertus
has a simpler method and abstracts from the specific
forms determined by capitalist production for society as a whole;
he simply calls the means of production &#8216;capital&#8217; and the article
of consumption &#8216;revenue&#8217; and leaves it at that.</p>

<p>&#8216;The essential influence of ownership in land and capital
applies only to individuals having traffic with one another. If
the nation is taken as a unit, the effects of such ownership upon
the individuals completely disappear.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>We see that as soon as Rodbertus comes up against the real
problem, the capitalist aggregate product and its movements,
he exhibits the Utopian&#8217;s characteristic obtuseness in respect of
the historical peculiarities of production. Marx&#8217;s comment on
Proudhon, that &#8216;speaking of society as a whole, he pretends that
this society is no longer capitalist&#8217; therefore fits him like a glove.
The case of Rodbertus again exemplifies how every economist
before Marx had been at a loss when it came to harmonising the
concrete aspects of the labour process with the perspective of
capitalist production which regards everything in terms of value,
to mediating between the forms of movement performed by individual
capitals and the movement of social capital. Such
efforts as a rule vacillate from one extreme to another: the
shallow approach of Say and MacCulloch, recognising only the
conceptions of individual capital, and the Utopian approach of
Proudhon and Rodbertus who recognise only those of the process
of labour. That is the context in which Marx&#8217;s penetration
appears in its true light. His diagram of simple reproduction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
illuminates the entire problem by gathering up all these perspectives
in their harmony and their contradictions, and so resolves
the hopeless obscurities of innumerable tomes into two
rows of figures of striking simplicity.</p>

<p>On the strength of such views on capital and income as these,
capitalist appropriation is clearly quite impossible to understand.
Indeed, Rodbertus simply brands it as &#8216;robbery&#8217; and
indicts it before the forum of the rights of property it so blatantly
violates.</p>

<p>&#8216;This personal freedom of the workers which ought legally to
involve ownership in the value of the labour product, leads in
practice to their renunciation of the proprietary claims extorted
under pressure of ownership in land and capital; but the owners
do not admit to this great and universal wrong, almost as
though they were instinctively afraid that history might follow
its own stern and inexorable logic.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>Rodbertus&#8217; &#8216;theory in all its details is therefore conclusive
proof that those who praise present-day relations of ownership
without being able at the same time to ground ownership in
anything but labour, completely contradict their own principle.
It proves that the property relations of to-day are in fact founded
on a universal violation of this principle, that the great individual
fortunes being amassed in society nowadays are the result
of cumulative robbery mounting up in society with every new-born
worker since time immemorial.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>Since surplus value is thus branded as &#8216;robbery&#8217;, an increasing
rate of surplus value must appear &#8216;as a strange error of present-day
economic organisation&#8217;. Brissot&#8217;s crude paradox with its
revolutionary ring&mdash;&#8216;property is theft&#8217;&mdash;had been the starting
point for Proudhon&#8217;s first pamphlet, but Rodbertus&#8217; thesis is
quite another matter, arguing that capital is theft perpetrated
on property. It need only be set side by side with Marx&#8217;s chapter
on the transformation of the laws of ownership into the laws of
capitalist appropriation&mdash;this triumph of historical dialectics in
vol. i of Marx&#8217;s <i>Capital</i>&mdash;in order to show up Rodbertus&#8217;
&#8216;priority&#8217;. By ranting against capitalist appropriation under the
aspect of the &#8216;right of property&#8217;, Rodbertus closed his mind to
capital as the source of surplus value just as effectively as he had
previously been prevented by his tirades against &#8216;saving&#8217; from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
seeing the surplus value as a source of capital. He is thus in an
even worse position than v. Kirchmann, lacking all qualifications
for understanding capitalist accumulation.</p>

<p>What it amounts to is that Rodbertus wants unrestricted
expansion of production without saving, that is to say without
capitalist accumulation! He wants an unlimited growth of
the productive forces, and at the same time a rate of surplus
value stabilised by an act of law. In short, he shows himself
quite unable to grasp the real foundations of capitalist production
he wishes to reform, and to understand the most important
results of the classical economics he criticises so adversely.</p>

<p>It is no more than to be expected, therefore, that Prof. Diehl
should declare Rodbertus a pioneer of economic theory on the
strength of his &#8216;new theory of income&#8217; and of the distinction
between the logical and the historical categories of capital
(capital properly so-called in contrast to individual capital),
that Prof. Adolf Wagner should call him the &#8216;Ricardo of
economic socialism&#8217;, proving himself ignorant at once of
Ricardo, Rodbertus and socialism alike. Lexis even judges that
Rodbertus is at least the equal of &#8216;his British rival&#8217; in power
of abstract thinking, and by far his superior in &#8216;virtuosity to
lay bare the phenomena in their ultimate connections&#8217;, in
&#8216;imaginative vitality&#8217;, and above all in his &#8216;ethical approach to
economic life&#8217;. Rodbertus&#8217; real achievements in economic theory
however, other than his critique of Ricardo&#8217;s ground rent, his
at times quite clear-cut distinction between surplus value and
profit, his treatment of the surplus value as a whole in deliberate
contrast with its partial manifestations, his critique of Smith&#8217;s
dogma concerning the analysis of commodities in terms of value,
his precise formulation of the periodical character of the crises
and his analysis of their manifestations&mdash;all these attempts to
carry the investigation beyond Smith, Ricardo and Say, promising
as such, though doomed to failure because of the confused
basic concepts, are rather above the heads of Rodbertus&#8217; official
admirers. As Franz Mehring already pointed out, it was
Rodbertus&#8217; strange fortune to be lauded to heaven for his
alleged prowess in economics by the same people who called
him to task for his real merits in politics. This contrast between
economic and political achievements, however, does not concern
us here: in the realm of economic theory, his admirers built
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
him a grand memorial on the barren field he had dug with the
hopeless zeal of the visionary, while the modest beds where he
had sown a few fertile seeds, were allowed to be smothered with
weeds and forgotten.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>It cannot be said that the problem of accumulation had on
the whole been much advanced beyond the first controversy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
by this Prusso-Pomeranian treatment. If in the interim the
economic theory of harmony had dropped from the level of
Ricardo to that of a Bastiat-Schultze, social criticism had correspondingly
declined from Sismondi to Rodbertus. Sismondi&#8217;s
critique of 1819 had been an historical event, but Rodbertus&#8217;
ideas of reform, even on their first appearance, were a miserable
regression&mdash;still more so on their subsequent reiteration.</p>

<p>In the controversy between Sismondi on the one hand and
Say and Ricardo on the other, one party proved that accumulation
was impossible because of the crises, and therefore warned
against full development of the productive forces. The other
party proved that crises were impossible and advocated an unlimited
development of accumulation. Though all argued from
wrong premises, each was logically consistent.</p>

<p>v. Kirchmann and Rodbertus both started, were bound to
start, from the fact of crises. Here the problem of enlarged reproduction
of aggregate capital, the problem of accumulation, was
completely identified with the problem of crises and side-tracked
in an attempt to find a remedy for the crises, although the
historical experience of fifty years had shown all too clearly that
crises, as witnessed by their periodical recurrence, are a necessary
phase in capitalist reproduction. One side now sees the
remedy in the complete consumption of the surplus value by the
capitalist, that is to say in refraining from accumulation, the
other in stabilisation of the rate of surplus value by legislative
measures which comes to the same thing, i.e. renouncing
accumulation altogether. This special fad of Rodbertus&#8217; sprang
from his fervent and explicit belief in an unlimited capitalist
expansion of the productive forces and of wealth, without
accumulation of capital. At a time when capitalist production
was developed to a degree which was soon to enable Marx to
make his fundamental analysis, the last attempt of bourgeois
economics to cope with the problem of reproduction degenerated
into absurd and puerile Utopianism.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XVIII</i></h2>

<h2>A NEW VERSION OF THE PROBLEM</h2>

<p>The third controversy about capitalist accumulation takes
place in an historical setting quite different from that of
the two earlier ones. The time now is the period from the
beginning of the eighties to the middle of the nineties, the scene
Russia. In Western Europe, capitalism had already attained
maturity. The rose-coloured classical view of Smith and Ricardo
in a budding bourgeois economy had long since vanished ...
the self-interested optimism of the vulgarian Manchester doctrine
of harmony had been silenced by the devastating impact
of the world collapse in the seventies, and under the heavy
blows of a violent class struggle that blazed up in all capitalist
countries after the sixties. Even that harmony patched up with
social reformism which had its hey-day after the early eighties,
especially in Germany, soon ended in a hangover. The trial of
twelve years&#8217; special legislation against the Social Democratic
Party had brought about bitter disillusionment, and ultimately
destroyed all the veils of harmony, revealing the cruel capitalist
contradictions in their naked reality. Since then, optimism had
only been possible in the camp of the rising working class and its
theorists. This was admittedly not optimism about a natural, or
artificially established equilibrium of capitalist economy, or
about the eternal duration of capitalism, but rather the conviction
that capitalism, by mightily furthering the development of
the productive forces, and in virtue of its inherent contradictions,
would provide an excellent soil for the historical progress of
society towards new economic and social forms. The negative,
depressing tendency of the first stage of capitalism, at one time
realised by Sismondi alone and still observed by Rodbertus as
late as the forties and fifties, is compensated by a tendency
towards elation: the hopeful and victorious striving of the
workers for ascendancy in their trade-union movement and by
political action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
Such was the setting in Western Europe. In the Russia of that
time, however, the picture was different indeed. Here, the
seventies and eighties represent in every respect a period of
transition, a period of internal crises with all its agonies. Big
industry only now staged its real entry, fostered by the period of
high protective tariffs. In particular, the introduction of a tariff
on gold at the Western frontier in 1877 was a special landmark
in the absolutist government&#8217;s new policy of forcing the growth
of capitalism. &#8216;Primitive accumulation&#8217; of capital flourished
splendidly in Russia, encouraged by all kinds of state subsidies,
guarantees, premiums and government orders. It earned profits
which would already seem legendary to the West. Yet the
picture of internal conditions in contemporary Russia was anything
but attractive and auspicious. On the plains, the decline
and disintegration of rural economy under the pressure of
exploitation by the Exchequer and the monetary system caused
terrible conditions, periodical famines and peasant risings. In
the towns, again, the factory proletariat had not yet been consolidated,
either socially or mentally, into a modern working
class. For the greater part, it was still closely connected with
agriculture, and remained semi-rural, particularly in the large
industrial parts of Moscow-Vladimir, the most important centre
of the Russian textile industry. Accordingly, primitive forms of
exploitation were countered by primitive measures of defence.
Not until the early eighties did the spontaneous factory revolts
in the Moscow district with their smashing up of machines provide
the impetus for the first rudiments of factory legislation in
the Czarist Empire.</p>

<p>If the economic aspect of Russian public life showed at every
step the harsh discords of a period of transition, there was a
corresponding crisis in intellectual life. &#8216;Populism&#8217;, the indigenous
brand of Russian socialism, theoretically grounded in
the peculiarities of the Russian agrarian constitution, was politically
finished with the failure of the terrorist party of &#8216;Narodnaya
Volya&#8217;, its extreme revolutionary exponent. The first
writings of George Plekhanov, on the other hand, which were to
pave the way in Russia for Marxist trains of thought, had only
been published in 1883 and 1885, and for about a decade they
seemed to have little influence. During the eighties and up to the
nineties the mental life of the Russian, and in particular of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
socialist intelligentsia with their tendency towards opposition,
was dominated by a peculiar mixture of &#8216;indigenous&#8217; &#8216;populist&#8217;
remnants and random elements of theoretical Marxism. The
most remarkable feature of this mixture was scepticism as to the
possibility of capitalist development in Russia.</p>

<p>At an early date, the Russian intelligentsia had been preoccupied
with the question whether Russia should follow the
example of Western Europe and embark on capitalist development.
At first, they noticed only the bleak aspects of capitalism
in the West, its disintegrating effects upon the traditional patriarchal
forms of production and upon the prosperity and assured
livelihood for the broad masses of the population. As against
that, the Russian rural communal ownership in land, the famous
<i>obshchina</i>, seemed to offer a short-cut to the blessed land of
socialism, a lead direct to a higher social development of Russia,
without the capitalist phase and its attendant misery as experienced
in Western Europe. Would it be right to fling away this
fortunate and exceptional position, this unique historical opportunity,
and forcibly transplant capitalist production to Russia
with the help of the state? Would it be right to destroy the system
of rural holdings and production, and open the doors wide to
proletarisation, to misery and insecurity of existence for the
toiling masses?</p>

<p>The Russian intelligentsia was preoccupied with this fundamental
problem ever since the Agrarian Reform, and even
earlier, since Hertzen, and especially since Chernishevski. This
was the wholly unique world view of &#8216;populism&#8217; in a nutshell.
An enormous literature was created in Russia by this intellectual
tendency ranging from the avowedly reactionary doctrines
of the Slavophiles to the revolutionary theory of the
terrorist party. On the one hand, it encouraged the collection of
vast material by separate inquiries into the economic forms of
Russian life, into &#8216;national production&#8217; and its singular aspects,
into agriculture as practised by the peasant communes, into the
domestic industries of the peasants, the <i>artel</i>, and also into the
mental life of the peasants, the sects and similar phenomena.
On the other hand, a peculiar type of <i>belles lettres</i> sprang up as
the artistic reflection of the contradictory social conditions, the
struggle between old and new ways which beset the mind at
every step with difficult problems. Finally, in the seventies and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
eighties, a peculiarly stuffy philosophy of history sprang up
from the same root and found its champions in Peter Lavrov,
Nicolai Mikhailovski, Professor Kareyev and V. Vorontsov. It
was the &#8216;subjective method in sociology&#8217; which declared &#8216;critical
thought&#8217; to be the decisive factor in social development, or
which, more precisely, sought to make a down-at-heel intelligentsia
the agent of historical progress.</p>

<p>Here we are interested only in one aspect of this wide field
with its many ramifications, <i>viz</i>: the struggle of opinions regarding
the chances of capitalist development, and even then only in
so far as these were based upon general reflections on the social
conditions of the capitalist mode of production, since these latter
were also to play a big part in the Russian controversial literature
of the eighties and nineties.</p>

<p>The point at issue was to begin with Russian capitalism and
its prospects, but this, of course, led further afield to the whole
problem of capitalist development. The example and the experiences
of the West were adduced as vital evidence in this debate.</p>

<p>One fact was of decisive importance for the theoretical content
of the discussion that followed: not only was Marx&#8217;s analysis
of capitalist production as laid down in the first volume of
<i>Capital</i> already common property of educated Russia, but the
second volume, too, with its analysis of the reproduction of
capital as a whole had already been published in 1885. This
gave a fundamentally new twist to the discussion. No more did
the problem of crises obscure the real crux of the problem: for
the first time, the argument centred purely in the reproduction
of capital as a whole, in accumulation. Nor was the analysis
bogged any longer by an aimless fumbling for the concepts of
income and of individual and aggregate capital. Marx&#8217;s diagram
of social reproduction had provided a firm foothold. Finally, the
issue was no longer between <i>laissez-faire</i> and social reform, but
between two varieties of socialism. The petty-bourgeois and
somewhat muddled &#8216;populist&#8217; brand of Russian socialists stood
for scepticism regarding the possibility of capitalist development,
much in the spirit of Sismondi and, in part, of Rodbertus,
though they themselves frequently cited Marx as their authority.
Optimism, on the other hand, was represented by the
Marxist school in Russia. Thus the setting of the stage had been
shifted completely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
One of the two champions of the &#8216;populist&#8217; movement,
Vorontsov, known in Russia mainly under the <i>nom de plume</i> V. V.,
(his initials), was an odd customer. His economics were completely
muddled, and as an expert on theory he cannot be taken
seriously at all. The other, Nikolayon (Danielson), however,
was a man of wide education, and thoroughly conversant with
Marxism. He had edited the Russian translation of the first
volume of <i>Capital</i> and was a personal friend of Marx and
Engels, with both of whom he kept up a lively correspondence
(published in the Russian language in 1908). Nevertheless it was
Vorontsov who influenced public opinion among the Russian
intelligentsia in the eighties, and Marxists in Russia had to fight
him above all. As for our problem: the general prospects of
capitalist development, a new generation of Russian Marxists,
who had learned from the historical experience and knowledge
of Western Europe, joined forces with George Plekhanov in
opposition to the above-mentioned two representatives of
scepticism in the nineties. They were amongst others Professor
Kablukov, Professor Manuilov, Professor Issayev, Professor
Skvortsov, Vladimir Ilyin, Peter v. Struve, Bulgakov, and Professor
Tugan Baranovski. In the further course of our investigation
we shall, however, confine ourselves to the last three of
these, since every one of them furnished a more or less finished
critique of this theory on the point with which we are here
concerned. This battle of wits, brilliant in parts, which kept the
socialist intelligentsia spellbound in the nineties and was only
brought to an end by the walkover of the Marxist school,
officially inaugurated the infiltration into Russian thought of
Marxism as an economico-historical theory. &#8216;Legalist&#8217; Marxism
at that time publicly took possession of the Universities, the
Reviews and the economic book market in Russia&mdash;with all
the disadvantages of such a position. Ten years later, when
the revolutionary risings of the proletariat demonstrated in the
streets the darker side of this optimism about capitalist development,
none of this Pleïad of Marxist optimists, with but a single
exception, was to be found in the camp of the proletariat.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XIX</i></h2>

<h2>VORONTSOV AND HIS &#8216;SURPLUS&#8217;</h2>

<p>The representatives of Russian &#8216;populism&#8217; were convinced
that capitalism had no future in Russia, and this conviction
brought them to the problem of capitalist reproduction.
V. V. laid down his theories on this point in a series of
articles in the review <i>Patriotic Memoirs</i> and in other periodicals
which were collected and published in 1882 under the title
<i>The Destiny of Capitalism in Russia</i>. He further dealt with the
problem in &#8216;The Commodity Surplus in the Supply of the
Market&#8217;,<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>  &#8217;Militarism and Capitalism&#8217;,<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>  <i>Our Trends</i>,<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>  and finally
in <i>Outlines of Economic Theory</i>.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>  It is not easy to determine
Vorontsov&#8217;s attitude towards capitalist development in Russia.
He sided neither with the purely slavophil theory which
deduced the perversity and perniciousness of capitalism for
Russia from the &#8216;peculiarities&#8217; of the Russian economic structure
and a specifically Russian &#8216;national character&#8217;, nor with the
Marxists who saw in capitalist development an unavoidable
historical stage which is needed to clear the way towards social
progress for Russian society, too. Vorontsov for his part simply
asserts that denunciation and acclamation of capitalism are
equally futile because, having no roots in Russia, capitalism
is just impossible there and can have no future. The essential
conditions of capitalist development are lacking in Russia, and
love&#8217;s labour&#8217;s lost if the state tries to promote it artificially&mdash;one
might as well spare these efforts together with the heavy
sacrifices they entail. But if we look into the matter more closely,
Vorontsov&#8217;s thesis is not nearly so uncompromising. For if we
pay attention to the fact that capitalism does not mean only the
accumulation of capital wealth but also that the small producer
is reduced to the proletarian level, that the labourer&#8217;s livelihood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
is not assured and that there are periodical crises, then Vorontsov
would by no means deny that all these phenomena exist in
Russia. On the contrary, he explicitly says in his preface to
<i>The Destiny of Capitalism in Russia</i>: &#8216;Whilst I dispute the possibility
of capitalism as a form of production in Russia, I do not
intend to commit myself in any way as to its future as a form or
degree of exploiting the national resources.&#8217;</p>

<p>Vorontsov consequently is of the opinion that capitalism in
Russia merely cannot attain the same degree of maturity as in
the West, whereas the severance of the immediate producer
from the means of production might well be expected under
Russian conditions. Vorontsov goes even further: he does not
dispute at all that a development of the capitalist mode of production
is quite possible in various branches of production, and
even allows for capitalist exports from Russia to foreign markets.
Indeed he says in his essay on &#8216;The Commodity Surplus in the
Supply of the Market&#8217; that &#8216;in several branches of industry,
capitalist production develops very quickly&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>  [in the Russian
meaning of the term, of course&mdash;R. L.].</p>

<p>&#8216;It is most probable that Russia, just like any other country,
enjoys certain natural advantages which enable her to act as a
supplier of certain kinds of commodities on foreign markets. It is
extremely possible that capital can profit by this fact and lay
hands upon the branches of production concerned&mdash;that is to
say the (inter)national division of labour will make it easy for
our capitalists to gain a foothold in certain branches. This,
however, is not the point. We do not speak of a merely incidental
participation of capital in the industrial organisation of the
country, but ask whether it is likely that the entire production
of Russia can be put on a capitalist basis.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>Put in this form, Vorontsov&#8217;s scepticism looks quite different
from what might have been expected at first. He doubts whether
the capitalist mode of production could ever gain possession of
the entire production in Russia; but then, capitalism has not so
far accomplished this feat in any country of the world, not even
in England. Such a brand of scepticism as to the future of
capitalism appears at a glance quite international in outlook.
And indeed, Vorontsov&#8217;s theory here amounts to a quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
general reflection on the nature and the essential conditions of
capitalism; it is based upon a general theoretical approach to
the reproductive process of social capital as a whole. Vorontsov
gives the following very clear formulation of the specific relations
between the capitalist mode of production and the problem of
markets:</p>

<p>&#8216;The (inter)national division of labour, the distribution of all
branches of industry among the countries taking part in international
commerce, is quite independent of capitalism.</p>

<p>&#8216;The market which thus comes into being, the demand for the
products of different countries resulting from such a division of
labour among the nations, has intrinsically nothing in common
with the market required by the capitalist mode of production....
The products of capitalist industry come on the market for
another purpose; the question whether all the needs of the
country are satisfied is irrelevant to them, and the entrepreneur
does not necessarily receive in their stead another material product
which may be consumed. Their main purpose is to realise
the surplus value they contain. What, then, is this surplus value
that it should interest the capitalist for its own sake? From our
point of view, it is the surplus of production over consumption
inside the country. Every worker produces more than he himself
can consume, and all these surplus items accumulate in a few
hands; their owners themselves consume them, exchanging
them for the purpose against the most variegated kinds of
necessities and luxuries. Yet eat, drink and dance as much as
they like&mdash;they will not be able to squander the whole of the
surplus value: a considerable remnant will be left over, of which
they have to dispose somehow even though they cannot exchange
it for other products. They must convert it into money,
since it would otherwise just go bad. Since there is no one inside
the country on whom the capitalists could foist this remnant, it
must be exported abroad, and that is why foreign markets are
indispensable to countries embarking on the capitalist venture.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>The above is a literal translation, showing all the peculiarities
of Vorontsov&#8217;s diction, so that the reader may have a taste of
this brilliant Russian theorist with whom one can spend moments
of sheer delight.</p>

<p>Later, in 1895, Vorontsov summarised the same views in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
book <i>Outlines of Economic Theory</i> now claiming our attention.
Here he takes a stand against the views of Say and Ricardo, and
in particular also against John Stuart Mill who denied the possibility
of general over-production. In the course of his argument
he discovers something no one had known before: he has laid
bare the source of all errors the classical school made about the
problem of crises. This mistake lies in a fallacious theory of the
costs of production to which bourgeois economists are addicted.
No doubt, from the aspect of the costs of production (which
according to Vorontsov&#8217;s equally unheard-of assumption do not
comprise profits), both profit and crises are unthinkable and
inexplicable. But we can only appreciate this original thought
to the full in the author&#8217;s own words:</p>

<p>&#8216;According to the doctrine of bourgeois economists, the value
of a product is determined by the labour employed in its manufacture.
Yet bourgeois economists, once they have given this
determination of value, immediately forget it and base their
subsequent explanation of the exchange phenomena upon a
different theory which substitutes &#8220;costs of production&#8221; for
labour. Thus two products are mutually exchanged in such
quantities that the costs of production are equal on both sides.
Such a view of the process of exchange indeed leaves no room
for a commodity surplus inside the country. Any product of a
worker&#8217;s annual labour must, from this point of view, represent
a certain quantity of material of which it is made, of tools which
have been used in its manufacture, and of the products which
served to maintain the workers during the period of production.
It [presumably the product&mdash;R. L.] appears on the market in
order to change its use-form, to reconvert itself into objects, into
products for the workers and the value necessary for renewing
the tools. As soon as it is split up into its component parts, the
process of reassembling, the productive process, will begin, in
the course of which all the values listed above will be consumed.
In their stead, a new product will come into being which is the
connecting link between past and future consumption.&#8217;</p>

<p>From this perfectly unique attempt to demonstrate social reproduction
as a continuous process in the light of the costs of
production, the following conclusion is promptly drawn: Considering
thus the aggregate bulk of a country&#8217;s products, we
shall find no commodity surplus at all over and above the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
demand of society; an unmarketable surplus is therefore impossible
from the point of view of a bourgeois economic theory
of value.&#8217;</p>

<p>Yet, after having eliminated capitalist profit from the costs of
production by an extremely autocratic manhandling of the
bourgeois theory of value, Vorontsov immediately presents this
deficiency as a great discovery: &#8216;The above analysis, however,
reveals yet another feature in the theory of value prevalent of
late: it becomes evident that this theory leaves no room for
capitalist profits.&#8217;</p>

<p>The argument that follows is striking in its brevity and
simplicity: &#8216;Indeed, if I exchange my own product, representing
a cost of production of 5 roubles, for another product of
equal value, I receive only so much as will be sufficient to cover
my expense, but for my abstinence [literally so&mdash;R. L.] I shall
get nothing.&#8217;</p>

<p>And now Vorontsov really comes to grips with the root of the
problem:</p>

<p>&#8216;Thus it is proved on a strictly logical development of the
ideas held by bourgeois economists that the destiny of the commodity
surplus on the market and that of capitalist profit is
identical. This circumstance justifies the conclusion that both
phenomena are interdependent, that the existence of one is a
condition of the other, and indeed, so long as there is no profit,
there is no commodity surplus.... It is different if the profit
comes into being inside the country. Such profit is not originally
related to production; it is a phenomenon which is connected
with the latter not by technical and natural conditions but by
an extraneous social form. Production requires for its continuation
... only material, tools, and means of subsistence for the
workers, therefore as such it consumes only the corresponding
part of the products: other consumers must be found for the
surplus which makes up the profit, and for which there is no
room in the permanent structure of industrial life, in production&mdash;consumers,
namely, who are not organically connected with
production, who are fortuitous to a certain extent. The necessary
number of such consumers may or may not be forthcoming,
and in the latter case there will be a commodity surplus on the
market.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
Well content with the &#8216;simple&#8217; enlightenment, by which he
has turned the surplus product into an invention of capital and
the capitalist into a &#8216;fortuitous&#8217; consumer who is &#8216;not organically
connected with capitalist production&#8217;, Vorontsov now turns to
the crises. On the basis of Marx&#8217;s &#8216;logical&#8217; theory of the value of
labour which he claims to &#8216;employ&#8217; in his later works, he
expounds them as an immediate result of the surplus value, as
follows:</p>

<p>&#8216;If the working part of the population consumes what enters
into the costs of production in form of the wages for labour, the
capitalists themselves must destroy [literally so&mdash;R. L.] the
surplus value, excepting that part of it which the market
requires for expansion. If the capitalists are in a position to do
so and act accordingly, there can be no commodity surplus; if
not, over-production, industrial crises, displacement of the
workers from the factories and other evils will result.&#8217;</p>

<p>According to Vorontsov, however, it is &#8216;<i>the inadequate elasticity
of the human organism</i> which cannot enlarge its capacity to consume
as rapidly as the surplus value is increasing&#8217;, which is in
the end responsible for these evils. He repeatedly expresses this
ingenious thought as follows: &#8216;The Achilles heel of capitalist
industrial organisation thus lies in the incapacity of the entrepreneurs
to consume the whole of their income.&#8217;</p>

<p>Having thus &#8216;employed&#8217; Marx&#8217;s &#8216;logical&#8217; version of Ricardo&#8217;s
theory of value, Vorontsov arrives at Sismondi&#8217;s theory of crises
which he adopts in as crude and simplified a form as possible.
He believes, of course, that he is adopting the views of Rodbertus
in reproducing those of Sismondi. &#8216;The inductive method
of research&#8217;, he declares triumphantly, &#8216;has resulted in the very
same theory of crises and of pauperism which had been objectively
stated by Rodbertus.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>It is not quite clear what Vorontsov means by an &#8216;inductive
method of research&#8217; which he contrasts with the objective
method&mdash;since all things are possible to Vorontsov, he may conceivably
mean Marx&#8217;s theory. Yet Rodbertus, too, was not to
emerge unimproved from the hands of the original Russian
thinker. Vorontsov corrects Rodbertus&#8217; theory merely in so far
as he eliminates the stabilisation of the wage rate in accordance
with the value of the aggregate product which, to Rodbertus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
had been the pivot of his whole system. According to Vorontsov,
this measure against crises is a mere palliative, since &#8216;the immediate
cause of the above phenomena (over-production, unemployment,
etc.) is not that the working classes receive too
small a share of the national income, but that the capitalist class
cannot possibly consume all the products which every year fall
to their share.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>Yet, as soon as he has refuted Rodbertus&#8217; reform of the distribution
of incomes, Vorontsov, with that &#8216;strictly logical&#8217;
consistency so peculiar to him, ultimately arrives at the following
forecast for the future destiny of capitalism: &#8216;If industrial
organisation which prevails in W. Europe is to prosper and
flourish further still, it can only do so provided that some means
will be found to destroy [<i>verbatim</i>&mdash;R. L.] that portion of the
national income which falls to the capitalists&#8217; share over and
above their capacity to consume. The simplest solution of this
problem will be an appropriate change in the distribution of the
aggregate income among those who take part in production. If
the entrepreneurs would retain for themselves only so much of
all increase of the national income as they need to satisfy all
their whims and fancies, leaving the remainder to the working
class, the mass of the people, then the régime of capitalism would
be assured for a long time to come.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>The hash of Ricardo, Marx, Sismondi and Rodbertus thus is
topped with the discovery that capitalist production could be
radically cured of over-production, that it could &#8216;prosper and
flourish&#8217; in all eternity, if the capitalists would refrain from
capitalising their surplus value and would make a free gift to
the working class of the corresponding part of the surplus value.
Meanwhile the capitalists, until they have become sensible
enough to accept Vorontsov&#8217;s good advice, employ other means
for the annual destruction of a part of their surplus value.
Modern militarism, amongst others, is one of these appropriate
measures&mdash;and this precisely to the extent to which the bills of
militarism are footed by the capitalists&#8217; income&mdash;for Vorontsov
can be counted upon to turn things upside down&mdash;and not by
the working masses. A primary remedy for capitalism, however,
is foreign trade which again is a sore spot in Russian capitalism.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
As the last to arrive at the table of the world market, Russian
capitalism fares worst in the competition with older capitalist
countries and thus lacks both prospects as to foreign markets
and the most vital conditions of existence. Russia remains the
&#8216;country of peasants&#8217;, a country of &#8216;populist&#8217; production.</p>

<p>&#8216;If all this is correct,&#8217; Vorontsov concludes his essay on &#8216;The
Commodity Surplus in the Supply of the Market&#8217;, &#8216;then capitalism
can play only a limited part in Russia. It must resign from
the direction of agriculture, and its development in the industrial
sphere must not inflict too many injuries upon the domestic
industries which under our economic conditions are indispensable
to the welfare of the majority of the population. If the
reader would comment that capitalism might not accept such
a compromise, our answer will be: so much the worse for
capitalism.&#8217;</p>

<p>Thus Vorontsov ultimately washes his hands of the whole
thing, declining for his part all responsibility for the further
fortunes of economic development in Russia.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XX</i></h2>

<h2>NIKOLAYON</h2>

<p>The second theorist of populist criticism, Nikolayon,
brings quite a different economic training and knowledge
to his work. One of the best-informed experts on
Russian economic relations, he had already in 1880 attracted
attention by his treatise on the capitalisation of agricultural incomes,
which was published in the review <i>Slovo</i>. Thirteen years
later, spurred on by the great Russian famine of 1891, he
pursued his inquiries further in a book entitled <i>Outlines of Our
Social Economy Since the Reform</i>. Here he gives a detailed exposition,
fully documented by facts and figures, of how capitalism
developed in Russia, and on this evidence proceeds to show that
this development is the source of all evil, and so of the famine,
also, so far as the Russian people are concerned. His views about
the destiny of capitalism in Russia are grounded in a definite
theory about the conditions of the development of capitalist production
in general, and it is this with which we must now deal.</p>

<p>Since the market is of decisive importance for the capitalist
mode of economy, every capitalist nation tries to make sure of as
large a market as possible. In the first place, of course, it relies
on its home market. But at a certain level of development, the
home market is no longer sufficient for a capitalist nation, and
this for the following reasons: all that social labour newly produces
in one year can be divided into two parts&mdash;the share
received by the workers in the form of wages, and that which is
appropriated by the capitalists. Of the first part, only so many
means of subsistence as correspond, in value, to the sum total of
the wages paid within the country can be withdrawn from circulation.
Yet capitalist economy decidedly tends to depress this
part more and more. Its methods are a longer working day,
stepping up the intensity of labour, and increasing output by
technical improvements which enable the substitution of female
and juvenile for male labour and in some cases displace adult
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
labour altogether. Even if the wages of the workers still employed
are rising, such increase can never equal the savings of the
capitalists resulting from these changes. The result of all this is
that the working class must play an ever smaller part as buyers
on the home market. At the same time, there is a further change:
capitalist production gradually takes over even the trades which
provided additional employment to an agricultural people;
thus it deprives the peasants of their resources by degrees, so
that the rural population can afford to buy fewer and fewer
industrial products. This is a further reason for the continual
contraction of the home market. As for the capitalist class, we
see that this latter is also unable to realise the entire newly
created product, though for the opposite reason. However large
the requirements of this class, the capitalists will not be able to
consume the entire surplus product in person. First, because
part of it is needed to enlarge production, for technical improvements
which, to the individual entrepreneur, will be a necessary
condition of existence in a competitive society. Secondly,
because an expanding capitalist production implies an expansion
in those branches of industry which produce means of
production (e.g. the mining industry, the machine industry and
so forth) and whose products from the very beginning take a
use-form that is incapable of personal consumption and can
only function as capital. Thirdly and lastly, the higher labour
productivity and capital savings that can be achieved by mass
production of cheap commodities increasingly impel society
towards mass production of commodities which cannot all be
consumed by a mere handful of capitalists.</p>

<p>Although one capitalist can realise his surplus value in the
surplus product of another capitalist and <i>vice versa</i>, this is only
true for products of a certain branch, for consumer goods. However,
the incentive of capitalist production is not the satisfaction
of personal wants, and this is further shown by the progressive
decline in the production of consumer as compared to that of
producer goods.</p>

<p>&#8216;Thus we see that the aggregate product of a capitalist nation
must greatly exceed the requirements of the whole industrial
population employed, in the same way as each individual factory
produces vastly in excess of the requirements of both its
workers and the entrepreneur, and this is entirely due to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
fact that the nation is a capitalist nation, because the distribution
of resources within the society does not aim to satisfy the
real wants of the population but only the effective demand. Just
as an individual factory-owner could not maintain himself as a
capitalist even for a day if his market were confined to the
requirements of his workers and his own, so the home market of
a developed capitalist nation must also be insufficient.&#8217;</p>

<p>At a certain level, capitalist development thus has the tendency
to impede its own progress. These obstacles are ultimately
due to the fact that progressive labour productivity, involving
the severance of the immediate producer from the means of
production, does not benefit society as a whole, but only the
individual entrepreneur; and the mass of labour power and men-hours
which has been &#8216;set free&#8217; by this process becomes redundant
and thus is not only lost to society but will become a
burden to it. The real wants of the masses can only be satisfied
more fully in so far as there can be an ascendancy of a &#8216;populist&#8217;
mode of production based upon the union between the producer
and his means of production. It is the aim of capitalism, however,
to gain possession of just these spheres of production, and
to destroy in the process the main factor which makes for its
own prosperity. The periodical famines in India, for instance,
recurring at intervals of ten or eleven years, were thus among
the causes of periodical industrial crises in England. Any nation
that sets out on capitalist development will sooner or later come
up against these contradictions inherent in this mode of production.
And the later a nation embarks on the capitalist venture,
the more strongly will these contradictions make themselves
felt, since, once the home market has been saturated, no substitute
can be found, the outside market having already been
conquered by the older competing countries.</p>

<p>The upshot of it all is that the limits of capitalism are set by
the increasing poverty born of its own development, by the increasing
number of redundant workers deficient in all purchasing
power. Increasing labour productivity which can rapidly
satisfy every effective demand of society corresponds to the increasing
incapacity of ever broader masses of the population to
satisfy their most vital needs; on the one hand, a glut of goods
that cannot be sold&mdash;and on the other, large masses who lack
the bare necessities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
These are Nikolayon&#8217;s general views.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>  He knows his Marx, we
see, and has turned the two first volumes of <i>Capital</i> to excellent
use. And still, the whole trend of his argument is genuinely Sismondian.
It is capitalism itself which brings about a shrinking
home market since it impoverishes the masses; every calamity of
modern society is due to the destruction of the &#8216;populist&#8217; mode
of production, that is to say the destruction of small-scale enterprise.
That is his main theme. More openly even than Sismondi,
Nikolayon sets the tenor of his critique by an apotheosis of
small-scale enterprise, this sole approach to grace.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>  The aggregate
capitalist product cannot, in the end, be realised within
the society, this can only be done with recourse to outside
markets. Nikolayon here comes to the same conclusion as
Vorontsov, in spite of a quite different theoretical point of
departure. Applied to Russia, it is the economic scientific
ground for a sceptical attitude towards capitalism. Capitalist
development in Russia has been without access to foreign
markets from the first, it could only show its worst aspects&mdash;it
has impoverished the masses of the people. In consequence, it
was a &#8216;fatal mistake&#8217; to promote capitalism in Russia.</p>

<p>On this point, Nikolayon fulminates like a prophet of the Old
Testament: &#8216;Instead of keeping to the tradition of centuries,
instead of developing our old inherited principle of a close connection
between the immediate producer and his means of
production, instead of usefully applying the scientific achievements
of W. Europe to their forms of production based on the
peasants&#8217; ownership of their means of production, instead of increasing
their productivity by concentrating the means of production
in their hands, instead of benefiting, not by the forms
of production in W. Europe, but by its organisation, its powerful
co-operation, its division of labour, its machinery, etc., etc.&mdash;instead
of developing the fundamental principle of a landowning
peasantry and applying it to the cultivation of the land by
the peasants, instead of making science and its application
widely accessible to the peasants&mdash;instead of all this, we have
taken the opposite turning. We have failed to prevent the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
development of capitalist forms of production, although they
are based on the expropriation of the peasants; on the contrary,
we have promoted with all our might the upsetting of our
entire economic life which resulted in the famine of 1891.&#8217;</p>

<p>Though the evil is much advanced, it is not too late even now
to retrace our steps. On the contrary, a complete reform of
economic policy is just as urgently needed for Russia in view of
the threatening proletarisation and collapse, as Alexander&#8217;s
reforms after the Crimean war were necessary in their time.</p>

<p>Now a social reform as advocated by Nikolayon is completely
Utopian. His attitude exhibits an even more blatant
petty-bourgeois and reactionary bias than Sismondi&#8217;s ever did,
considering that the Russian &#8216;populist&#8217; writes after a lapse of
seventy years. For in his opinion, the old <i>obshchina</i>, the rural
community founded on the communal ownership of the soil, is
the raft to deliver Russia from the flood of capitalism. On it,
the discoveries of modern big industry and scientific technique
are to be grafted by measures which remain his own secret&mdash;so
that it can serve as the basis of a &#8216;socialised&#8217; higher form of production.
Russia can choose no other alternative: either she turns
her back upon capitalist development, or she must resign herself
to death and decay.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
After a crushing criticism of capitalism Nikolayon thus ends
up with the same old &#8216;populist&#8217; panacea which had as early as
the fifties, though at that time with greater justification, been
hailed as the &#8216;peculiarly Russian&#8217; guarantee of a higher social
development, although its reactionary character as a lifeless
relic of ancient institutions had been exposed in Engels&#8217; <i>Fluechtlingsliteratur</i>
in <i>Volksstaat</i> (1875). Engels wrote at the time:</p>

<p>&#8216;A further development of Russia on bourgeois lines would
gradually destroy communal property there too, quite apart
from any interference of the Russian government &#8220;with the
knout and with bayonets&#8221; (as the revolutionary populists
imagined). Under the pressure of taxes and usury, communal
landownership is no longer a privilege, it becomes an irksome
chain. The peasants frequently run away from it, either with or
without their families, to seek their living as itinerant labourers,
and leave the land behind. We see that communal ownership in
Russia has long since passed its flower and there is every indication
that its decay is approaching.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
With these words, Engels hits right on the target of the
<i>obshchina</i> problem&mdash;eighteen years before the publication of
Nikolayon&#8217;s principal work. If Nikolayon subsequently with renewed
courage again conjured up the ghost of the <i>obshchina</i>, it
was a bad historical anachronism inasmuch as about a decade
later the <i>obshchina</i> was given an official burial by the state. The
absolutist government which had for financial reasons tried
during half a century artificially to keep the machinery of the
rural community going was compelled to give up this thankless
task on its own accord. The agrarian problem soon made it
clear how far the old &#8216;populist&#8217; delusion was lagging behind the
actual course of economic events, and conversely, how powerfully
capitalist development in Russia, mourned and cursed as
still-born, could demonstrate with lightning and thunder its
capacity to live and to multiply. Once again, and for the last
time, this turn of events demonstrates in quite a different historical
setting how a social critique of capitalism, which begins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
by doubting its capacity for development, must by a deadly
logic lead to a reactionary Utopianism&mdash;both in the France of
1819 and in the Russia of 1893.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXI</i></h2>

<h2>STRUVE&#8217;S &#8216;THIRD PERSONS&#8217;
AND &#8216;THREE WORLD EMPIRES&#8217;</h2>

<p>We now turn to the criticism of the above opinions as
given by the Russian Marxists.</p>

<p>In 1894, Peter v. Struve who had already given a
detailed appraisal of Nikolayon&#8217;s book in an essay &#8216;On Capitalist
Development in Russia&#8217;,<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>  published a book in Russian,<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>  criticising
the theories of &#8216;populism&#8217; from various aspects. In respect
of our present problem, however, he mainly confines himself to
proving, against both Vorontsov and Nikolayon, that capitalism
does not cause a contraction of the home market but, on the
contrary, an expansion. There can be no doubt that Nikolayon
has made a blunder&mdash;the same that Sismondi had made. They
each describe only a single aspect of the destructive process, performed
by capitalism on the traditional forms of production by
small enterprise. They saw only the resulting depression of
general welfare, the impoverishment of broad strata of the population,
and failed to notice that economic aspect of the process
which entails the abolition of natural economy and the substitution
of a commodity economy in rural districts. And this is
as much as to say that, by absorbing further and further sections
of formerly independent and self-sufficient producers into its
own sphere, capitalism continuously transforms into commodity
buyers ever new strata of people who had not before bought its
commodities. In fact, the course of capitalist development is
just the opposite of that pictured by the &#8216;populists&#8217; on the model
of Sismondi. Capitalism, far from ruining the home market,
really sets about creating it, precisely by means of a spreading
money economy.</p>

<p>Struve in particular refutes the theory that the surplus value
cannot possibly be realised on the home market. He argues as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
follows: The conviction that a mature capitalist society consists
exclusively of entrepreneurs and workers forms the basis of
Vorontsov&#8217;s theory, and Nikolayon himself operates with this
concept throughout. From this point of view, of course, the
realisation of the capitalist aggregate product seems incomprehensible.
And Vorontsov&#8217;s theory is correct in so far as it states
the fact that neither the capitalists&#8217; nor the workers&#8217; consumption
can realise the surplus value, so that the existence of &#8216;third
persons&#8217; must be presumed.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>  But then, is it not beyond any
doubt that some such &#8216;third persons&#8217; exist in every capitalist
society? The idea of Vorontsov and Nikolayon is pure fiction
&#8216;which cannot advance our understanding of any historical process
whatever by a hair&#8217;s breadth&#8217;.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>  There is no actual capitalist
society, however highly developed, composed exclusively of
capitalists and workers.</p>

<p>&#8216;Even in England and Wales, out of a thousand self-supporting
inhabitants, 543 are engaged in industry, 172 in commerce,
140 in agriculture, 81 in casual wage labour, and 62 in the Civil
Service, the liberal professions and the like.&#8217;</p>

<p>Even in England, then, there are large numbers of &#8216;third
persons&#8217;, and it is they who, by their consumption, help to
realise the surplus value in so far as it is not consumed by the
capitalists. Struve leaves it open whether these &#8216;third persons&#8217;
consume enough to realise all surplus value&mdash;however that may
be, &#8216;the contrary would have to be proved&#8217;.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>  This cannot be
done, he claims, for Russia, that vast country with an immense
population. She, in fact, is in the fortunate position to be able
to dispense with foreign markets. In this&mdash;and here Struve dips
into the intellectual treasures of Professors Wagner, Schaeffle,
and Schmoller&mdash;she enjoys the same privileges as the United
States of America. &#8216;If the example of the N. American Union
stands for anything, it is proof of the fact that under certain circumstances
capitalist industry can attain a very high level of
development almost entirely on the basis of the home market.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
The negligible amount of industrial exports from the U.S.A.
in 1882 is mentioned in support of this statement which Struve
formulates as a general doctrine: &#8216;The vaster the territory, and
the larger the population of a country, the less does that country
require foreign markets for its capitalist development.&#8217; He infers
from this, in direct opposition to the &#8216;populists&#8217;, &#8216;a more brilliant
future (for Russia) than for the other countries&#8217;.</p>

<p>On the basis of commodity production, the progressive
development of agriculture is bound to create a market wide
enough to support the development of Russian industrial capitalism.
This market would be capable of unlimited expansion, in
step with the economic and cultural progress of the country, and
together with the substitution of a monetary for a natural
economy. &#8216;In this respect, capitalism enjoys more favourable
conditions in Russia than in other countries.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>Struve paints a detailed and highly coloured picture of the
new markets which, thanks to the Trans-Siberian Railway, are
opening up in Siberia, Central Asia, Asia Minor, Persia and the
Balkans. But his prophetic zeal blinds him to the fact that he
is no longer talking about the &#8216;indefinitely expanding&#8217; home
market but about specific foreign markets. In later years, he
was to throw in his lot, in politics too, with this optimistic
Russian capitalism and its liberal programme of imperialist
expansion, for which he had laid the theoretical foundations
when still a &#8216;Marxist&#8217;.</p>

<p>Indeed, the tenor of Struve&#8217;s argument is a fervent belief in
the unlimited capacity for expansion of capitalist production,
but the economic foundation of this optimism is rather weak.
He is somewhat reticent as to what he means by the &#8216;third
persons&#8217; whom he considers the mainstay of accumulation, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
his references to English occupational statistics indicate that he
has in mind the various private and public servants, the liberal
professions, in short the notorious <i>grand public</i> so dear to bourgeois
economists when they are completely at a loss. It is this
&#8216;great public&#8217; of which Marx said that it serves as the explanation
for things which the economist cannot explain. It is obvious
that, if we categorically refer to consumption by the capitalists
and the workers, we do not speak of the entrepreneur as an
individual, but of the capitalist class as a whole, including their
hangers-on&mdash;employees, Civil Servants, liberal professions, and
the like. All such &#8216;third persons&#8217; who are certainly not lacking in
any capitalist society are, as far as economics is concerned, joint
consumers of the surplus value for the greater part, in so far,
namely, as they are not also joint consumers of the wages of
labour. These groups can only derive their purchasing power
either from the wage of the proletariat or from the surplus
value, if not from both; but on the whole, they are to be regarded
as joint consumers of the surplus value. It follows that
their consumption is already included in the consumption of
the capitalist class, and if Struve tries to reintroduce them to the
capitalists by sleight-of-hand as &#8216;third persons&#8217; to save the situation
and help to realise the surplus value, the shrewd profiteer
will not be taken in. He will see at once that this great public is
nothing but his old familiar retinue of parasites who buy his
commodities with money of his own providing. No, no, indeed!
Struve&#8217;s &#8216;third persons&#8217; will not do at all.</p>

<p>Struve&#8217;s theory of foreign markets and their significance for
capitalist production is equally untenable. In this, he defers to
the mechanist approach of the &#8216;populists&#8217; who, along with the
professors&#8217; textbooks, hold that a capitalist (European) country
will first exploit the home market to the limit, and will only
look to foreign markets when this is almost or completely exhausted.
Then, following in the footsteps of Wagner, Schaeffle
and Schmoller, Struve arrives at the absurd conclusion that a
country with vast territories and a large population can make
its capitalist production a &#8216;self-contained whole&#8217; and rely indefinitely
on the home market alone.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>  In actual fact, capitalist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
production is by nature production on a universal scale. Quite
contrary to the bookish decrees issued by German scholars, it
is producing for a world market already from the word <i>go</i>. The
various pioneering branches of capitalist production in England,
such as the textile, iron and coal industries, cast about for
markets in all countries and continents, long before the process
of destroying peasants&#8217; property, the decline of handicraft and
of the old domestic industries within the country had come to
an end. And again, is it likely that the German chemical or
electrotechnical industries would be grateful for the sober
advice not to work for five continents, as they have done from
the beginning, but to confine themselves to the German home
market which, being largely supplied from abroad, is evidently
far from exhausted in respect of a whole lot of other German
industries? Or that one should explain to the German machine
industry, it should not venture yet upon foreign markets, since
German import statistics are visible proof that a good deal of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
the demand in Germany for products of this branch is satisfied
by foreign supplies? No, this schematic conception of &#8216;foreign
trade&#8217; does not help us at all to grasp the complexity of the
world market with its uncounted ramifications and different
shades in the division of labour. The industrial development of
the U.S.A. who have already at the time of writing become a
dangerous rival to Britain both on the world market and even
in England herself, just as they have beaten German competition,
e.g. in the sphere of electrotechnics, both in the world
market and in Germany herself, has given the lie to Struve&#8217;s
inferences, already out-of-date when they were put on paper.</p>

<p>Struve also shares the crude view of the Russian &#8216;populists&#8217;
who saw hardly more than a merchant&#8217;s sordid concern for his
market in the international connections of capitalist economy,
and its historical tendency to create a homogeneous living
organism based on social division of labour as well as the countless
variety of natural wealth and productive conditions of the
globe. Moreover he accepts the Three Empire fiction of Wagner
and Schmoller (the self-contained Empires of Great Britain,
Russia and the U.S.A.) which completely ignores or artificially
minimises the vital part played by an unlimited supply of means
of subsistence, of raw and auxiliary materials and of labour
power which is just as necessary for a capitalist industry computed
in terms of a world market as the demand for finished products.
Alone the history of the English cotton industry, a reflection
in miniature of the history of capitalism in general, spreading
over five continents throughout the nineteenth century,
makes a mockery of the professors&#8217; childish pretensions which
have only one real significance: to provide the theoretical
justification for the system of protective tariffs.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXII</i></h2>

<h2>BULGAKOV AND HIS COMPLETION
OF MARX&#8217;S ANALYSIS</h2>

<p>The second critic of &#8216;populist&#8217; scepticism, S. Bulgakov, is
no respecter of Struve&#8217;s &#8216;third persons&#8217; and at once
denies that they form the sheet-anchor for capitalist
accumulation.</p>

<p>&#8216;The majority of economists before Marx&#8217;, he declares, &#8216;solved
the problem by saying that some sort of &#8220;third person&#8221; is
needed, as a <i>deus ex machina</i>, to cut the Gordian knot, i.e. to
consume the surplus value. This part is played by luxury-loving
landowners (as with Malthus), or by indulgent capitalists, or
yet by militarism and the like. There can be no demand for the
surplus value without some such extraordinary mediators; a
deadlock will be reached on the markets and the result will be
over-production and crises.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>&#8216;Struve thus assumes that capitalist production in its development,
too, may find its ultimate mainstay in the consumption of
some fantastic sort of &#8220;third person&#8221;. But if this great public is
essentially characterised as consuming the surplus value, whence
does it obtain the means to buy?&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>For his part, Bulgakov centres the whole problem from the
first in the analysis of the social aggregate product and its reproduction
as given by Marx in the second volume of <i>Capital</i>.
He has a thorough grasp of the fact that he must start with
simple reproduction and must fully understand its working in
order to solve the question of accumulation. In this context, he
says, it is of particular importance to obtain a clear picture of
the consumption of surplus value and wages in such branches
of production as do not turn out goods for consumption, and
further, to understand fully the circulation of that portion of the
social aggregate product which represents used-up constant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
capital. This, he argues, is a completely new problem of which
economists had not even been aware before Marx brought it
up. &#8216;In order to solve this problem, Marx divides all capitalistically
produced commodities into two great and fundamentally
different categories: the production of producer and consumer
goods. There is more theoretical importance in this division
than in all previous squabbles on the theory of markets.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>Bulgakov, we see, is an outspoken and enthusiastic supporter
of Marx&#8217;s theory. The object of his study, as he puts it, is thus
a critique of the doctrine that capitalism cannot exist without
external markets. &#8216;For this purpose, the author has made use of
the most valuable analysis of social reproduction given by Marx
in volume ii of <i>Capital</i> which for reasons unknown has scarcely
been utilised in economic theory. Though this analysis cannot
be taken as fully completed, we are yet of opinion that even in
its present fragmentary shape it offers an adequate foundation
for a solution of the market problem that differs from that
adopted by Messrs. Nikolayon, V. V. and others, and which
they claim to have found in Marx.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>Bulgakov gives the following formulation of his solution
which he has deduced from Marx himself: &#8216;In certain conditions,
capitalism may exist solely by virtue of an internal market.
It is not an inherent necessity peculiar to the capitalist mode of
production that the outside market be able to absorb the surplus
of capitalist production. The author has arrived at this conclusion
in consequence of his study of the above-mentioned
analysis of social reproduction.&#8217;</p>

<p>And now we are eager to hear the arguments Bulgakov has
based on the above thesis.</p>

<p>At first sight, they prove surprisingly simple: Bulgakov faithfully
reproduces Marx&#8217;s well-known diagram of simple reproduction,
adding comments which do credit to his insight. He
further cites Marx&#8217;s equally familiar diagram of enlarged reproduction&mdash;and
this indeed is the proof we have been so anxious
to find.</p>

<p>&#8216;Consequent upon what we have said, it will not be difficult
now to determine the very essence of accumulation. The means-of-production
department I must produce additional means
of production necessary for enlarging both its own production
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
and that of Department II. II, in its turn, will have to supply
additional consumption goods to enlarge the variable capital in
both departments. Disregarding the circulation of money, the
expansion of production is reduced to an exchange of additional
products of I needed by II against additional products of II
needed by I.&#8217;</p>

<p>Loyally following Marx&#8217;s deductions, Bulgakov does not
notice that so far his entire thesis is nothing but words. He
believes that these mathematical <i>formulæ</i> solve the problem of
accumulation. No doubt we can easily imagine proportions such
as those he has copied from Marx, and <i>if there is expanding production</i>,
these <i>formulæ</i> will apply. Yet Bulgakov overlooks the
principal problem: who exactly is to profit by an expansion such
as that whose mechanism he examines? Is it explained just because
we can put the mathematical proportions of accumulation
on paper? Hardly, because just as soon as Bulgakov has declared
the matter settled and goes on to introduce the circulation of
money into the analysis, he right away comes up against the
question: where are I and II to get the money for the purchase
of additional products? When we dealt with Marx, time and
again the weak point in his analysis, the question really of consumers
in enlarged reproduction, cropped up in a perverted
form as the question of additional money sources. Here Bulgakov
quite slavishly follows Marx&#8217;s approach, accepting his misleading
formulation of the problem without noticing that it is not
straightforward, although he knows perfectly well that &#8216;Marx
himself did not answer this question in the drafts which were
used to compile the second volume of <i>Capital</i>&#8217;. It should be all
the more interesting to see what answer Marx&#8217;s Russian pupil
attempted to work out on his own.</p>

<p>&#8216;The following solution&#8217;, Bulgakov says, &#8216;seems to us to correspond
best to Marx&#8217;s doctrine as a whole: The new variable
capital in money-form supplied by II for both departments has
its commodity equivalent in surplus value II. With reference to
simple reproduction, we have already seen that the capitalists
themselves must throw money into circulation to realise their
surplus value, money which ultimately reverts to the pocket of
the very capitalist it came from. The quantity of money required
for the circulation of the surplus value is determined in
accordance with the general law of commodity circulation by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
the value of the commodities that contained it, divided by the
average amount of money turnover. This same law must apply
here; the capitalists of Department II must dispose of a certain
amount of money for the circulation of their surplus value, and
must consequently possess certain money reserves. These reserves
must be ample enough for the circulation both of that
portion of the surplus value which represents the consumption
fund and of that which is to be accumulated as capital.&#8217;</p>

<p>Bulgakov further argues that it is immaterial to the question
how much money is required to circulate a certain amount of
commodities inside a country, whether or not some of these
commodities contain any surplus value. &#8216;In answer to the general
question as to money sources inside the country, however,
our solution is that the money is supplied by the producer of
gold.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>If a country requires more money consequent upon an &#8216;expansion
of production&#8217;, the production of gold will have to be
increased accordingly. So here we are again: the producer of
gold is again the <i>deus ex machina</i>, just as he had been for Marx.
In fact, Bulgakov has sadly disappointed us in the high hopes
we had of his new solution. His &#8216;solution&#8217; of the problem does
not go a step beyond Marx&#8217;s own analysis. It can be reduced to
three extremely simple statements as follows: (1) Question: How
much money do we need for the realisation of capitalised surplus
value? Answer: Just as much as is required in accordance
with the general law of commodity circulation. (2) Q.: Where
do the capitalists get the money for the realisation of capitalised
surplus value? A.: They are supposed to have it. (3) Q.: How
did the money come into the country in the first place? A.: It is
provided by the producer of gold. The extreme simplicity of
this method of explanation is suspicious rather than attractive.</p>

<p>We need not trouble, however, to refute this theory which
makes the gold producer the <i>deus ex machina</i> of capitalist accumulation.
Bulgakov has done it himself quite adequately. Eighty
pages on, he returns to the gold producer in quite a different
context, in the course of a lengthy argument against the
theory of the wages fund in which he got involved for some
mysterious reason. Here he suddenly displays a keen grasp of
the problem:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
&#8216;We know already that there is a gold producer amongst
other producers. Even under conditions of simple reproduction,
he increases, on the one hand, the absolute quantity of money
circulating inside the country, and on the other, he buys producer
and consumer goods without, in his turn, selling commodities,
paying with his own product, i.e. with the general
exchange equivalent, for the goods he buys. The gold producer
now might perhaps render the service of buying the whole
accumulated surplus value from II and pay for it in gold which
II can then use to buy means of production from I and to
increase its variable capital needed to pay for additional labour
power so that the gold producer now appears as the real
external market.</p>

<p>&#8216;This assumption, however, is quite absurd. To accept it
would mean to make the expansion of social production dependent
upon the expansion of gold production. (Hear, hear!) This
in turn presupposes an increase in gold production which is
quite unreal. If the gold producer were obliged to buy all the
accumulated surplus value from II for his own workers, his own
variable capital would have to grow by the day and indeed by
the hour. Yet his constant capital as well as his surplus value
should also grow in proportion, and gold production as a whole
would consequently have to take on immense dimensions.
(Hear, hear!) Instead of submitting this sophistical presumption
to statistical tests&mdash;which in any case would hardly be possible&mdash;a
single fact can be adduced which would alone refute this
presupposition: it is the development of the institution of credit
which accompanies the development of capitalist economy.
(Hear, hear!) Credit has the tendency to diminish the amount
of money in circulation (this decrease being, of course, only
relative, not absolute); it is the necessary complement of a
developing economy of exchange which would otherwise soon
find itself hampered by a lack of coined money. I think we need
not give figures in this context to prove that the rôle of money
in exchange-transactions is now very small. The hypothesis is
thus proved in immediate and evident disagreement with the
facts and must be confuted.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>Bravo! Bravissimo! This is really excellent! Bulgakov, however,
thus &#8216;confutes&#8217; also his former explanation of the question,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
in what way and by whom capitalised surplus value is realised.
Moreover, in refuting his own statements, Bulgakov has only
explained in somewhat greater detail what Marx expressed in a
single word when he called the hypothesis of a gold producer
swallowing up the entire surplus value of society&mdash;&#8216;absurd&#8217;.</p>

<p>Admittedly, Bulgakov&#8217;s real solution and that of Russian
Marxists in general who deal extensively with the problem
must be sought elsewhere. Just like Tugan Baranovski and
Ilyin [Lenin], Bulgakov underlines the fact that the opposing
sceptics made a capital error with respect to the possibility of
accumulation in analysing the value of the aggregate product.
They, especially Vorontsov, assumed that the aggregate social
product consists in consumer goods, and they all started from
the false premise that consumption is indeed the object of capitalist
production. This, as the Marxists now explain, is the source
of the entire misunderstanding&mdash;of all the imaginary difficulties
connected with the realisation of the surplus value, with which
the sceptics racked their brains.</p>

<p>&#8216;This school created non-existent difficulties because of this
mistaken conception. Since the normal conditions of capitalist
production presuppose that the capitalists&#8217; consumption fund
is only a part of the surplus value, and the smaller part at that,
the larger being set aside for the expansion of production, it is
obvious that the difficulties imagined by this (the <i>populist</i>)
school do not really exist.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>The unconcern with which Bulgakov here ignores the real
problem is striking. Apparently it has not dawned on him that
the question as to the ultimate beneficiaries, quite irrelevant so
long as personal consumption of the entire surplus value is
assumed, only becomes acute on the assumption of enlarged
reproduction.</p>

<p>All these &#8216;imaginary difficulties&#8217; vanish, thanks to two discoveries
of Marx&#8217;s which his Russian pupils untiringly quote
against their opponents. The first is the fact that, in terms of
value, the social product is composed, not of <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>, but of <i>c</i>&nbsp;+ <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>.
Secondly, the ratio of <i>c</i> to <i>v</i> in this sum continually increases
with the progress of capitalist production, and at the same time,
the capitalised part of the surplus value as against that part of
it that is consumed, is ever growing. On this basis, Bulgakov
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
establishes a complete theory of the relations between production
and consumption in a capitalist society. As this theory plays
such an important part for the Russian Marxists in general,
and Bulgakov in particular, it will be necessary to get better
acquainted with it.</p>

<p>&#8216;Consumption,&#8217; Bulgakov says, &#8216;the satisfaction of social
needs, is but an incidental moment in the circulation of capital.
The volume of production is determined by the volume of
capital, and not by the amount of social requirements. Not
alone that the development of production is unaccompanied
by a growth in consumption&mdash;the two are mutually antagonistic.
Capitalist production knows no other than effective consumption,
but only such persons who draw either surplus value
or labour wages can be effective consumers, and their purchasing
power strictly corresponds to the amount of those
revenues. Yet we have seen that the fundamental evolutionary
laws of capitalist production tend, despite the absolute increase,
to diminish the relative size of variable capital as well as of the
capitalists&#8217; consumption fund. We can say, then, <i>that the development
of production diminishes consumption</i>.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>  The conditions of production
and of consumption are thus in conflict. Production
cannot and does not expand to further consumption. Expansion,
however, is an inherent fundamental law of capitalist production
and confronts every individual capitalist in the form of a
stern command to compete. This contradiction is negligible in
view of the fact that expanding production as such represents a
market for additional products. &#8220;Inherent contradictions are
resolved by an extension of the outlying fields of production.&#8221;&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
(Bulgakov here quotes a saying of Marx which he has thoroughly
misunderstood; we shall later have occasion to deal with it once
more.) &#8216;It has just been shown how this is possible.&#8217; (A reference
to the analysis of the diagram of enlarged reproduction.) &#8216;Evidently,
the greater share of the expansion is apportioned to
Department I, to the production, that is to say, of constant
capital, and only a (relatively) smaller part to Department II
which produces commodities for immediate consumption. This
change in the relations of the two departments shows well
enough what part is played by consumption in a capitalist
society, and it indicates where we should expect to find the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
important demand for capitalist commodities.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>  &#8216;Even within
the narrow limits of the profit motive and the crises, even on
this strait and narrow path, capitalist production is capable
of unlimited expansion, irrespective of, and even despite, a
decrease in consumption. The Russian literature frequently
points out that in view of diminishing consumption a considerable
increase of capitalist production is impossible without external
markets, but this is due to a wrong evaluation of the part
played by consumption in a capitalist society, the failure to
appreciate that consumption is not the ultimate end of capitalist
production. Capitalist production does not exist by the grace of
an increase in consumption but because of an extension of the
outlying fields of production which in fact constitute the market
for capitalist products. A whole progression of Malthusian investigators,
discontented with the superficial harmony doctrine
of the school of Say and Ricardo, have slaved away at a solution
of the hopeless undertaking: to find means of increasing
consumption which the capitalist mode of production is bound
to decrease. Marx was the only one to analyse the real connections:
he has shown that the growth of consumption is fatally
lagging behind that of production, and must do so whatever
&#8220;third persons&#8221; one might invent. Consumption and its volume
then should by no means be considered as establishing the
immediate limits to the expansion of production. Capitalist production
atones by the crises for deviating from the true purpose
of production, but it is independent of consumption. The expansion
of production is alone limited by, and dependent upon, the
volume of capital.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>The theory of Bulgakov and Tugan Baranovski is here directly
attributed to Marx. In the eyes of the Russian Marxists, it is on
the whole the direct consequence of Marx&#8217;s doctrine, of which
it forms an organic part. On another occasion Bulgakov says
even more clearly that it is a faithful interpretation of Marx&#8217;s
diagram of enlarged reproduction. Once a country has embraced
capitalist production, its internal movement develops along the
following lines:</p>

<p>&#8216;The production of constant capital makes up the Department
I of social reproduction, thereby instituting an independent
demand for consumption goods to the extent of both its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
own variable capital and the consumption fund of its capitalists.
Department II in its turn starts the demand for the products of
Department I. <i>Thus a closed circle is already formed at the initial
stage of capitalist production, in which it depends on no external market
but is self-sufficient and can grow, of itself, as it were, by means of
accumulation.</i>&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>In the hands of the Russian Marxists this theory becomes the
favourite stick with which to beat their opponents, the &#8216;populist&#8217;
sceptics, in the question of markets. We can only appreciate
its daring to the full when we look at its amazing discrepancy
with everyday practice, with all the known facts of capitalist
economy. A thesis pronounced so triumphantly as the purest
Marxist gospel is even more deserving of our admiration when
we consider that it is grounded in an extremely simple confusion.
We shall have further occasion to deal with this confusion
when we come to the doctrine of Tugan Baranovski.</p>

<p>Bulgakov further develops a completely erroneous theory
of foreign commerce, based upon his misapprehension of the
relations between consumption and production in capitalist
economy. A picture of reproduction like the above in fact has
no room for foreign commerce. If capitalism forms a &#8216;closed
circle&#8217; in every country from the very beginning, if, chasing its
tail like a puppy and in complete &#8216;self-sufficiency&#8217;, it is able of
itself to create an unlimited market for its products and can
spur itself on to ever greater expansion, then every capitalist
country as such must also be a closed and self-sufficient economic
whole. In but a single respect would foreign commerce
appear reasonable: to compensate, by imports from abroad, for
certain deficiencies due to the soil and the climate, i.e. the
import of raw materials or foodstuffs from sheer necessity. Completely
upsetting the thesis of the &#8216;populists&#8217;, Bulgakov in fact
advances a theory of international commerce among capitalist
states which gives pride of place to the import of agricultural
products, with industrial exports merely providing the requisite
funds.</p>

<p>International traffic in commodities does not here seem to
flow from the character of the mode of production but from the
natural conditions of the countries concerned. This theory at
any rate has not been borrowed from Marx but from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
economic experts of the German bourgeoisie. Just as Struve
took over from Wagner and Schaeffle his Three Empire Theory,
so Bulgakov adopts from the late List (<i>R.I.P.</i>) the division of
states on the basis of &#8216;agriculture&#8217; and &#8216;mixed agriculture and
manufacture&#8217;, or rather adapts it, in deference to the times, to
the categories of &#8216;manufacture&#8217; and &#8216;mixed manufacture and
agriculture&#8217;. Nature has afflicted the first category with a
deficiency in raw materials and foodstuffs, making it thus dependent
upon foreign commerce. The second category has been
liberally endowed with all it needs; here foreign trade is of no
account. The prototype of the first category is England, of the
second&mdash;the U.S.A. The stoppage of foreign commerce would
mean the economic death-blow to England, but only a temporary
crisis in the U.S.A. with a guarantee of full recovery.</p>

<p>&#8216;Production there is capable of unlimited expansion on the
basis of the internal market.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>This theory, a hoary relic of German economics even now,
has obviously not the least grasp of the interrelations obtaining
in an international capitalist economy. It conceives of modern
international trade in terms that may have been appropriate
to the times of the Phoenicians. Just listen to the lecture of
Professor Buecher:</p>

<p>&#8216;Although the liberalist era has greatly facilitated international
traffic, it would be a mistake to infer from this that the
period of a national economy is nearing its end, to be replaced
by a period of international economy.... Granted that we see
in Europe to-day a number of small countries that are not independent
nations in respect of their commodity supply, being
compelled to import substantial amounts of their foodstuffs and
luxuries, while their industrial productivity is in excess of the
national needs and creates a permanent surplus for which
employment must be found in alien spheres of consumption.
Yet although countries of industrial production and those producing
raw materials exist side by side and depend upon one
another, such &#8220;international division of labour&#8221; should not
be regarded as a sign that mankind is about to attain to a
higher stage of development which it would be proper to contrast,
under the label of world economy, with the ... previous
stages. No stage of economic development has ever permanently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
guaranteed full autonomy in the satisfaction of wants. Every
one of them has left certain gaps which had to be filled in by
some means or other. So-called &#8220;international economy&#8221;, on
the other hand, has not, at any rate so far, engendered any
phenomena which are essentially different from those of national
economy, and we very much doubt that such phenomena will
appear in the near future.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>As far as Bulgakov is concerned, this conception at any rate
results in an unexpected conclusion: his theory of the unlimited
capacity for development of capitalism is confined to
certain countries with favourable natural conditions. Capitalism
in England is foredoomed because the world market will be
exhausted before long. In the U.S.A., India and Russia it can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
look forward to an unlimited development because these countries
are &#8216;self-sufficient&#8217;.</p>

<p>Apart from these obvious peculiarities, Bulgakov&#8217;s arguments
about foreign commerce again imply a fundamental misconception.
Against the sceptics, from Sismondi to Nikolayon, who
believed that they had to take recourse to outside markets for
the realisation of capitalist surplus value, he chiefly argues as
follows:</p>

<p>&#8216;These experts obviously consider external commerce as a
&#8220;bottomless pit&#8221; to swallow up in all eternity the surplus value
which cannot be got rid of inside the country.&#8217;</p>

<p>Bulgakov for his part triumphantly points out that foreign
commerce is indeed not a pit and certainly not a bottomless one,
but rather appears as a double-edged sword, that exports always
belong with imports, and that the two usually counterbalance
one another. Thus, whatever is pushed out over one border, will
be brought back, in a changed use-form, over another. &#8216;We
must find room for the commodities that have been imported
as an equivalent of those exported, within the bounds of the
given market, and as this is impossible, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, it would
only generate new difficulties to have recourse to an external
demand.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>On another occasion he says that the way to realise the
surplus value found by the Russian &#8216;populists&#8217;, viz. external
markets, &#8216;is much less favourable than that discovered by
Malthus, v. Kirchmann and Vorontsov himself when he wrote
the essay <i>On Militarism and Capitalism</i>&#8217;.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>Although Bulgakov fervently copies Marx&#8217;s diagram of reproduction,
he here exhibits no grasp whatever of the real problem
towards which the sceptics from Sismondi to Nikolayon
were groping their way. He denies that foreign commerce solves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
the difficulty as pretended, since it again brings the surplus
value that has been disposed of into the country, although in a
&#8216;changed form&#8217;. In conformity with the crude picture of
v. Kirchmann and Vorontsov, he thus believes the problem to
be that of destroying a certain quantity of the surplus value, of
wiping it from the face of the earth. It simply does not occur to
him that the real problem is the realisation of the surplus value,
the metamorphosis of commodities, in fact the &#8216;changed form&#8217;
of the surplus value.</p>

<p>Bulgakov thus finally arrives at the same goal as Struve,
though by a different route. He preaches the self-sufficiency of
capitalist accumulation which swallows up its own product as
Kronos swallows up his children, and breeds ever more vigorously
without help from outside. Now only one further step is
needed for Marxism to revert to bourgeois economics, and this,
as luck would have it, was taken by Tugan Baranovski.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXIII</i></h2>

<h2>TUGAN BARANOVSKI
AND HIS &#8216;LACK OF PROPORTION&#8217;</h2>

<p>We have left this theorist to the end, although he
already developed his views in Russian in 1894, i.e.
before Struve and Bulgakov, partly because he only
gave his theories their mature form in German at a later
date,<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>  and also because the conclusions he draws from the
premises of the Marxist critics are the most far-reaching in their
implications.</p>

<p>Like Bulgakov, Tugan Baranovski starts from Marx&#8217;s analysis
of social reproduction which gave him the clue to this bewildering
maze of problems. But while Bulgakov, the enthusiastic disciple
of Marx, only sought to follow him faithfully and simply
attributed his own conclusions to the master, Tugan Baranovski,
on the other hand, lays down the law to Marx who, in his
opinion, did not know how to turn his brilliant exposition of the
reproductive process to good account. Tugan Baranovski&#8217;s most
important general conclusion from Marx&#8217;s principles, the pivot
of his whole theory, is that, contrary to the assumptions of the
sceptics, capitalist accumulation is not only possible under the
capitalist forms of revenue and consumption, but is, in fact,
completely independent of both. It is not consumption, he says,
but production itself which makes for the best market. Production
and the market are therefore the same, and since the
expansion of production is unlimited in itself, the market, the
capacity to absorb its products, has no limits either.</p>

<p>&#8216;The diagram quoted&#8217;, he says, &#8216;was to prove conclusively a
postulate which, though simple enough, might easily give rise
to objections, unless the process be adequately understood&mdash;the
postulate, namely, that capitalist production creates a market
for itself. So long as it is possible to expand social production, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
the productive forces are adequate for this purpose, the proportionate
division of social production must also bring about a
corresponding expansion of the demand inasmuch as under
such conditions all newly produced goods represent a newly
created purchasing power for the acquisition of other goods.
Comparing simple reproduction of the social capital with its
reproduction on a rising scale, we arrive at the most important
conclusion that in capitalist economy the demand for commodities
is in a sense independent of the total volume of social
consumption. Absurd as it may seem to &#8220;common-sense&#8221;, it is
yet possible that the volume of social consumption as a whole
goes down while at the same time the aggregate social demand
for commodities grows.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>And again further on: &#8216;Arising from the abstract analysis of
the reproductive process of social capital we have formed the
conclusion that nothing will be left over of the social product in
view of the proportionate division of the social capital.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly Tugan Baranovski subjects Marx&#8217;s theory of
crises to a revision which he claims to have developed from
Sismondi&#8217;s &#8216;over-consumption&#8217;. &#8216;Marx is in substantial agreement
with the general view that the poverty of the workers, i.e.
of the great majority of the population, makes it impossible to
realise the products of an ever expanding capitalist production,
since it causes a decline in demand. This opinion is definitely
mistaken. We have seen that capitalist production creates its
own market&mdash;consumption being only one of the moments of
capitalist production. In a planned social production if the
leaders of production were equipped with all <i>information</i> about
the demand and with the <i>power</i> to transfer labour and capital
freely from one branch of production to another, then, however
low the level of social consumption, the supply of commodities
would not exceed the demand.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>The only circumstance which periodically causes the market
to be flooded is a lack of proportion in the enlargement of production.
On this assumption, therefore, Tugan Baranovski
describes the course of capitalist accumulation as follows: &#8216;What
would the workers ... produce if production were organised on
proportionate lines? Obviously their own means of subsistence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
and production. With what object? To expand production in
the second year. The production of what products? Again of
means of production and subsistence for the workers&mdash;and so on
<i>ad infinitum</i>.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>This game of question and answer, mind you, is not a form
of self-mockery, it is meant in all seriousness. &#8216;If the expansion
of production has no practical limits, then we must assume that
the expansion of markets is equally unlimited, for <i>if social production
is proportionately organised, there is no limit to the expansion of
the market other than the productive forces available</i>.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>Since production thus creates its own demand, foreign commerce
of capitalist states is also assigned that peculiar mechanistic
function we have already met in Bulgakov. A foreign
market, for instance, is an absolute necessity for England. &#8216;Does
not this prove that capitalist production creates a surplus product
for which there is no room on the internal market? Why,
come to that, does England require an external market? The
answer is not difficult: because a considerable part of England&#8217;s
purchasing power is expended on obtaining foreign commodities.
The import of foreign commodities for the English home
market also makes it essential to export English commodities
abroad. Since England cannot manage without importing from
abroad, exports are a vital condition for that country, since
without them she would not be able to pay for her imports.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>Here again agricultural imports are described as a stimulating
and decisive factor, quite in accordance with the scheme
of the German professors.</p>

<p>What, then, is the general line of reasoning on which Tugan
Baranovski supports his daring solution of the problem of
accumulation, the new revelation on the problem of crises and
a whole lot of others? Hard to believe, but quite incontrovertible
for all that, Tugan Baranovski&#8217;s proof consists exclusively and
entirely&mdash;in Marx&#8217;s diagram of enlarged reproduction, no more
no less. Although he repeatedly refers rather pompously to his
&#8216;abstract analysis of the reproductive process of social capital&#8217;,
to the &#8216;conclusive logic&#8217; of his analysis, this entire analysis is
nothing but a copy of Marx&#8217;s diagram of enlarged reproduction,
with a different set of figures. Nowhere in the entire works of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
Tugan Baranovski shall we find a trace of any other argument.
In Marx&#8217;s diagram, admittedly, accumulation, production,
realisation and exchange run smoothly with clockwork precision,
and no doubt this kind of &#8216;accumulation&#8217; can continue
<i>ad infinitum</i>, just as long, that is to say, as ink and paper do not
run out. And it is this harmless written exercise with mathematical
equations which Tugan Baranovski quite seriously considers
a <i>demonstration</i> of such a course in real events.</p>

<p>&#8216;The diagrams we have adduced are bound to prove conclusively
that....&#8217;</p>

<p>On another occasion he counters Hobson, who is convinced
that accumulation is impossible, with the following words:
&#8216;Diagram No. 2 of the reproduction of social capital on a rising
scale corresponds to the case of capital accumulation Hobson
has in mind. But does this diagram show a surplus product to
come into being? Far from it.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>Hobson is refuted and the matter settled because &#8216;in the
diagram&#8217; no surplus product comes into being.</p>

<p>Admittedly, Tugan Baranovski knows quite well that in hard
fact things do not work out so smoothly. There are continual
fluctuations in the exchange relations and periodical crises. But
these crises happen only because in the expansion of production
the proper proportions are not maintained, because, that is to
say, the proportions of &#8216;diagram No. 2&#8217; are not observed in the
first place. If they were, there would be no crisis, and capitalist
production could get along as nicely as it does on paper, in
every detail. Tugan Baranovski is committed to the view that
we can ignore the crises if we consider the reproductive process
as a continuous process. Although the &#8216;proportion&#8217; may be upset
at any moment, yet on average it will always be re-established
by different deviations, by price-fluctuations from day to day,
and in the long run by periodical crises. That on the whole this
&#8216;proportion&#8217; is more or less maintained is proved by the fact that
capitalist economy is still going strong&mdash;otherwise it would long
ago have ended in chaos and collapse. In the long run, then,
Tugan Baranovski&#8217;s &#8216;proportion&#8217; is observed by and large, and
we must conclude that reality obeys &#8216;diagram No. 2&#8217;. And since
this diagram can be indefinitely extended, it follows that capitalist
accumulation can also proceed <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
What is striking in all this is not Tugan Baranovski&#8217;s conclusion
that the diagram corresponds to the actual course of
events&mdash;as we have seen, Bulgakov also shared this belief; the
really startling fact is that Tugan Baranovski sees no necessity
for as much as <i>inquiring</i> whether the diagram is correct,
that, instead of proving the diagram, he considers this, the
arithmetical exercise on paper, as proof of the actual state of
affairs. Bulgakov honestly tried to project Marx&#8217;s diagram on
the real concrete relations of capitalist economy and of capitalist
exchange; he endeavoured to overcome the difficulties resulting
from it, though without success, it is true, remaining to the last
involved with Marx&#8217;s analysis, which he himself recognised to
be incomplete and fragmentary. But Tugan Baranovski does not
need any proof, he does not greatly exercise his brains: since the
arithmetical sums come out satisfactorily, and may be continued
<i>ad lib.</i>, this is to him proof that capitalist accumulation
can also proceed without let or hindrance&mdash;provided the said
&#8216;proportion&#8217; obtains, which it will have to do by hook or by
crook, as he himself would not dream of denying.</p>

<p>Tugan Baranovski, however, has one indirect proof that the
diagram with its strange results corresponds to, and truly reflects,
reality. This is the fact that capitalist production, quite in
accordance with Marx&#8217;s diagram, puts human consumption
second to production, that it conceives of the former as a
means and of the latter as an end in itself, just as it puts human
labour, the &#8216;worker&#8217;, on a par with the machine.</p>

<p>&#8216;Technical progress is expressed by the fact that the means of
labour, the machine, increases more and more in importance as
compared to living labour, to the worker himself. Means of production
play an ever growing part in the productive process and
on the commodity market. Compared to the machine, the
worker recedes further into the background and the demand resulting
from the consumption of the workers is also put into the
shade by that which results from productive consumption by the
means of production. The entire workings of capitalist economy
take on the character of a mechanism existing on its own, as it
were, in which human consumption appears as a simple moment
of the reproductive process and the circulation of capitals.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>Tugan Baranovski considers this discovery as a fundamental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
law of the capitalist mode of production, which is confirmed by
a quite tangible phenomenon: with the progress of capitalist
development Department I goes on growing relatively to, and
at the expense of, Department II. It was Marx himself who, as
we all know, set up this law in which he grounded the schematic
exposition of reproduction, though in the further development
of his diagram he ignored subsequent alterations for simplicity&#8217;s
sake. This, the automatic growth of the producer goods as compared
with the consumer goods department affords Tugan
Baranovski the only objective proof of his theory: that in capitalist
society human consumption becomes increasingly unimportant,
and production more and more an end in itself. This
thesis forms the corner-stone of his entire theoretical edifice.</p>

<p>&#8216;In all the industrial countries&#8217;, he proclaims, &#8216;we are confronted
with the same type of development&mdash;the development
of national economy everywhere follows the same fundamental
law. The mining industry which creates the means of production
for modern industry comes more and more to the fore.
The relative decrease in the export of immediately consumable
manufactured goods from Britain is thus also an expression of
the fundamental law governing capitalist development. The
further technical progress advances, the more do consumer
goods recede as compared with producer goods. Human consumption
plays an ever decreasing part as against the productive
consumption of the means of production.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>Although this &#8216;fundamental law&#8217; like all his other &#8216;fundamental&#8217;
laws, in so far as they mean anything at all, is borrowed
ready-made from Marx, Baranovski does not rest content with
this and immediately proceeds to preach the Marxist gospel to
Marx himself. Scrabbling about like a blind hen, Marx has
turned up another pearl&mdash;Tugan will give him that&mdash;only he
does not know what to do with it. It needed a Tugan Baranovski
to know how to make it useful to science, and in his hand the
newly discovered law suddenly throws a new light on the whole
workings of capitalist economy. This law of the expansion in
the department of producer goods at the cost of that of consumer
goods reveals clearly, concisely, exactly, and in measurable
terms, that capitalist society attaches progressively less
importance to human consumption, putting man on the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
level as the means of production, and that Marx was therefore
completely wrong both in assuming that man alone, not the
machine, too, can be the creator of surplus value, and in saying,
further, that human consumption represents a limit for capitalist
production which is bound to cause periodical crises in the
present, and the collapse and terrible end of capitalist economy
in the near future. In short, the &#8216;fundamental law&#8217; governing
the increase of producer as compared to consumer goods reflects
the singular nature of capitalist society as a whole which Marx
had not understood and which to interpret happily fell to the
lot of Tugan Baranovski.</p>

<p>We have seen above the decisive part played by the &#8216;fundamental
law&#8217; of capital in the controversy between the Russian
Marxists and the sceptics. Bulgakov&#8217;s remarks we already know;
another Marxist already referred to, Vladimir Ilyin, expresses
himself in similar terms in his polemics against the &#8216;populists&#8217;:</p>

<p>&#8216;It is well known that the law of capitalist production consists
in the fact that the constant capital grows more rapidly than
the variable capital, that is to say an ever increasing part of the
newly formed capital falls to the department of social production
which creates producer goods. In consequence, this department
is absolutely bound to grow more rapidly than the
department creating consumer goods, that is to say, the very
thing happens which Sismondi declared to be &#8220;impossible&#8221;,
&#8220;dangerous&#8221;, etc. In consequence, consumer goods make up a
smaller and smaller share of the total bulk of capitalist production,
and this is entirely in accordance with the historical
&#8220;mission&#8221; of capitalism and its specific social structure: the
former in fact consists in the development of the productive
forces of society (production as an end in itself), and the latter
prevents that the mass of the population should turn them to
use.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>In this respect, of course, Tugan Baranovski goes even
farther. With his love of paradox he actually permits himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
the joke of submitting a mathematical proof that accumulation
of capital and expansion of production are possible even if the
absolute volume of production decreases. In this connection,
Karl Kautsky has pointed out, he had recourse to a somewhat
dubious scientific subterfuge, namely that he shaped his daring
deductions exclusively for a specific moment: the transition
from simple to enlarged reproduction&mdash;a moment which is
exceptional even in theory, but certainly of no practical significance
whatever.<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
As to Tugan Baranovski&#8217;s &#8216;fundamental law&#8217;, Kautsky
declares it to be a mere illusion due to the fact that Tugan
Baranovski considered the organisation of production only in
the old countries of capitalist big industry.</p>

<p>&#8216;It is correct&#8217;, Kautsky says, &#8216;that with a progressive division
of labour, there will be comparatively fewer and fewer factories
etc. for the production of goods direct for personal consumption,
together with a relative increase in the number of
those which supply both the former and one another with tools,
machines, raw materials, transport facilities and so on. While in
original peasant economy an enterprise that cultivated the flax
also made the linen with its own tools and got it ready for
human consumption, nowadays hundreds of enterprises may
share in the manufacture of a single shirt, by producing raw
cotton, iron rails, steam engines and railway trucks that bring it
to port, and so on. With international division of labour it will
happen that some countries&mdash;the old industrial countries&mdash;can
only slowly expand their production for personal consumption,
while making large strides in their production of producer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
goods which is much more decisive for the heartbeat of economic
life than the production of consumer goods. From the
point of view of the nation concerned, we might easily form the
opinion that producer goods can be turned out on a constantly
rising scale with a more rapid rate of increase than in the production
of consumer goods, and that their production is not
bound up with that of the latter.&#8217;</p>

<p>The opinion, that producer goods can be produced independent
of consumption, is of course a mirage of Tugan Baranovski&#8217;s,
typical of vulgar economics. Not so the fact cited in support
of this fallacy: the quicker growth of Department I as compared
with Department II is beyond dispute, not only in old
industrial countries but wherever technical progress plays a
decisive part in production. It is the foundation also of Marx&#8217;s
fundamental law that the rate of profit tends to fall. Yet in spite
of it all, or rather precisely for this reason, it is a howler if
Bulgakov, Ilyin and Tugan Baranovski imagine to have discovered
in this law the essential nature of capitalist economy as
an economic system in which production is an end in itself and
human consumption merely incidental.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
The growth of the constant at the expense of the variable
capital is only the capitalist expression of the general effects of
increasing labour productivity. The formula <i>c</i> greater than <i>v</i>
(<i>c</i> &gt; <i>v</i>), translated from the language of capitalism into that of
the social labour process, means only that the higher the productivity
of human labour, the shorter the time needed to
change a given quantity of means of production into finished
products.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
This is a universal law of human labour. It has been valid
in all pre-capitalist forms of production and will also be valid in
the future in a socialist order of society. In terms of the material
use-form of society&#8217;s aggregate product, this law must manifest
itself by more and more social labour time being employed in
the manufacture of producer than of consumer goods. In a
planned and controlled social economy, organised on socialist
lines, this transformation would in fact be more rapid even
than it is in contemporary capitalist economy. In the first
place, rational scientific techniques can only be applied on the
largest scale when the barriers of private ownership in land are
abolished. This will result in an immense revolution in vast
provinces of production which will ultimately amount to a replacement
of living labour by machine labour, and which will
enable us to tackle technical jobs on a scale quite impossible
under present day conditions. Secondly, the general use of
machinery in the productive process will be put on a new
economic basis. At present the machine does not compete with
living labour but only with that part of it that is paid. The cost
of the labour power which is replaced by the machine represents
the lowest limit of the applicability of the machine. Which
means that the capitalist becomes interested in a machine only
when the costs of its production&mdash;assuming the same level of
performance&mdash;amount to less than the wages of the workers it
replaces. From the point of view of the social labour process
which is the only one to matter in a socialist society, the machine
competes not with the labour that is necessary to maintain the
worker but with the labour he actually performs. In other
words, in a society that is not governed by the profit motive but
aims at saving human labour, the use of machinery is economically
indicated just as soon as it can save more human labour
than is necessary for making it, not to mention the many cases
where the use of machinery is desirable even if it does not
answer this economic minimum&mdash;for reasons of health and
similar considerations, in the interest of the workers themselves.
However that may be, the tension between the respective
economic usefulness of the machine in (<i>a</i>) a capitalist, and (<i>b</i>) a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
socialist society is at least equal to the difference between labour
and that part of it that is paid; it is, in other words, the precise
equivalent of the whole capitalist surplus value. Consequently,
if the capitalist profit motive is abolished and a social organisation
of labour introduced, the marginal use of the machine will
suddenly be increased by the whole extent of the capitalist surplus
value, so that an enormous field, not to be gauged as yet,
will be open to the triumphal march of the machine. This would
be tangible proof that the capitalist mode of production, alleged
to spur on to the optimum technical development, in fact sets
large social limits to technical progress, in form of the profit
motive on which it is based. It would show that as soon as these
limits are abolished, technical progress will develop such a
powerful drive that the technical marvels of capitalist production
will be child&#8217;s play in comparison.</p>

<p>In terms of the composition of the social product, this technical
transformation can only mean that, compared to the production
of consumer goods, the production of producer goods&mdash;measured
in units of labour time&mdash;must increase more rapidly
in a socialist society than it does even to-day. Thus the relation
between the two departments of social production which the
Russian Marxists took to reveal typical capitalist baseness, the
neglect of man&#8217;s need to consume, rather proves to be the precise
manifestation of the progressive subjection of nature to
social labour, which will become even more striking when production
is organised solely with a view to human needs. The
only objective proof for Tugan Baranovski&#8217;s &#8216;fundamental law&#8217;
thus collapses as a &#8216;fundamental&#8217; confusion. His whole construction,
including his &#8216;new theory of crises&#8217;, together with the &#8216;lack
of proportion&#8217;, is reduced to its foundations on paper: a slavish
copy of Marx&#8217;s diagram of enlarged reproduction.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXIV</i></h2>

<h2>THE END OF RUSSIAN &#8216;LEGALIST&#8217;
MARXISM</h2>

<p>The Russian &#8216;legalist&#8217; Marxists, and Tugan Baranovski
above all, can claim the credit, in their struggle
against the doubters of capitalist accumulation, of
having enriched economic theory by an application of Marx&#8217;s
analysis of the social reproductive process and its schematic
representation in the second volume of <i>Capital</i>. But in view of
the fact that this same Tugan Baranovski quite wrongly regarded
said diagram as the solution to the problem instead
of its formulation, his conclusions were bound to reverse the
basic order of Marx&#8217;s doctrine.</p>

<p>Tugan Baranovski&#8217;s approach, according to which capitalist
production can create unlimited markets and is independent of
consumption, leads him straight on to the thesis of Say-Ricardo,
i.e. a natural balance between production and consumption,
between supply and demand. The difference is simply that those
two only thought in terms of simple commodity circulation,
whilst Tugan Baranovski applies the same doctrine to the circulation
of capital. His theory of crises being caused by a &#8216;lack of
proportion&#8217; is in effect just a paraphrase of Say&#8217;s old trite
absurdity: the over-production of any one commodity only goes
to show under-production of another; and Tugan Baranovski
simply translates this nonsense into the terminology used in
Marx&#8217;s analysis of the reproductive process. Even though he
declares that, Say notwithstanding, general over-production is
quite possible in the light of the circulation of money which the
former had entirely neglected, yet it is in fact this very same
neglect, the besetting sin of Say and Ricardo in their dealings
with the problem of crises which is the condition for his delightful
manipulations with Marx&#8217;s diagram. As soon as it is applied
to the circulation of money, &#8216;diagram No. 2&#8217; begins to bristle
with spikes and barbs. Bulgakov was caught in these spikes when
he attempted to follow up Marx&#8217;s interrupted analysis to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
logical conclusion. This compound of forms of thought borrowed
from Marx with contents derived from Say and Ricardo
is what Tugan Baranovski modestly calls his &#8216;attempt at a synthesis
between Marx&#8217;s theory and classical economics&#8217;.</p>

<p>After almost a century, the theory of optimism which holds,
in the face of petty-bourgeois doubts, that capitalist production
is capable of development, returns, by way of Marx&#8217;s doctrine
and its &#8216;legalist&#8217; champions, to its point of departure, to Say and
Ricardo. The three &#8216;Marxists&#8217; join forces with the bourgeois
&#8216;harmonists&#8217; of the Golden Age shortly before the Fall when
bourgeois economics was expelled from the Garden of Innocence&mdash;the
circle is closed.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the &#8216;legalist&#8217; Russian Marxists
achieved a victory over their opponents, the &#8216;populists&#8217;, but that
victory was rather too thorough. In the heat of battle, all three&mdash;Struve,
Bulgakov and Tugan Baranovski&mdash;overstated their
case. The question was whether capitalism in general, and
Russian capitalism in particular, is capable of development;
these Marxists, however, proved this capacity to the extent of
even offering theoretical proof that capitalism can go on for
ever. Assuming the accumulation of capital to be without limits,
one has obviously proved the unlimited capacity of capitalism
to survive! Accumulation is the specifically capitalist method of
expanding production, of furthering labour productivity, of
developing the productive forces, of economic progress. If the
capitalist mode of production can ensure boundless expansion
of the productive forces, of economic progress, it is invincible
indeed. The most important objective argument in support of
socialist theory breaks down; socialist political action and the
ideological import of the proletarian class struggle cease to
reflect economic events, and socialism no longer appears an
historical necessity. Setting out to show that capitalism is
possible, this trend of reasoning ends up by showing that
socialism is impossible.</p>

<p>The three Russian Marxists were fully aware that in the
course of the dispute they had made an about-turn, though
Struve, in his enthusiasm for the cultural mission of capitalism,
does not worry about giving up a useful warrant.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>  Bulgakov
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
tried to stop the gaps now made in socialist theory with another
fragment of the same theory as best he could: he hoped that
capitalist society might yet perish, in spite of the immanent
balance between production and consumption, because of the
declining profit rate. But it was he himself who finally cut away
the ground from under this somewhat precarious comfort. Forgetting
the straw he had offered for the salvation of socialism,
he turned on Tugan Baranovski with the teaching that, in the
case of large capitals, the relative decline in the profit rate is
compensated by the absolute growth of capital.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>  More consistent
than the others, Tugan Baranovski finally with the crude joy
of a barbarian destroys all objective economic arguments in
support of socialism, thus building in his own spirit &#8216;a more
beautiful world&#8217; on an ethical foundation. &#8216;The individual protests
against an economic order which transforms the end (man)
into a means (production) and the means (production) into an
end.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>Our three Marxists demonstrated in person that the new
foundations of socialism had been frail and jerry-built. They
had hardly laid down the new basis for socialism before they
turned their backs on it. When the masses of Russia were staking
their lives in the fight for the ideals of a social order to come,
which would put the end (man) before the means (production),
the &#8216;individual&#8217; went into retreat, to find philosophical and
ethical solace with Kant. In actual fact, the &#8216;legalist&#8217; bourgeois
Marxists ended up just where we should expect them to from
their theoretical position&mdash;in the camp of bourgeois harmonies.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXV</i></h2>

<h2>CONTRADICTIONS WITHIN THE
DIAGRAM OF ENLARGED
REPRODUCTION</h2>

<p>In the first section, we ascertained that Marx&#8217;s diagram of
accumulation does not solve the question of who is to benefit
in the end by enlarged reproduction. If we take the diagram
literally as it is set out at the end of volume ii, it appears that
capitalist production would itself realise its entire surplus value,
and that it would use the capitalised surplus value exclusively
for its own needs. This impression is confirmed by Marx&#8217;s
analysis of the diagram where he attempts to reduce the circulation
within the diagram altogether to terms of money, that is
to say to the effective demand of capitalists and workers&mdash;an
attempt which in the end leads him to introduce the &#8216;producer
of money&#8217; as a <i>deus ex machina</i>. In addition, there is that most
important passage in <i>Capital</i>, volume i, which must be interpreted
to mean the same.</p>

<p>&#8216;The annual production must in the first place furnish all
those objects (use-values) from which the material components
of capital, used up in the course of the year, have to be replaced.
Deducting these there remains the net or surplus-product, in
which the surplus-value lies. And of what does this surplus-value
consist? Only of things destined to satisfy the wants and
desires of the capitalist class, things which, consequently, enter
into the consumption fund of the capitalists? Were that the
case, the cup of surplus-value would be drained to the very dregs,
and nothing but simple reproduction would ever take place.</p>

<p>&#8216;To accumulate it is necessary to convert a portion of the
surplus-product into capital. But we cannot, except by a miracle,
convert into capital anything but such articles as can be employed
in the labour-process (i.e. means of production), and
such further articles as are suitable for the sustenance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
labourer (i.e. means of subsistence). Consequently, a part of the
annual surplus-labour must have been applied to the production
of additional means of production and subsistence, over and
above the quantity of these things required to replace the capital
advanced. In one word, surplus-value is convertible into capital
solely because the surplus-product, whose value it is, already
comprises the material elements of new capital.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>The following conditions of accumulation are here laid down:
(1) The surplus value to be capitalised first comes into being in
the natural form of capital (as additional means of production
and additional means of subsistence for the workers). (2) The
expansion of capitalist production is achieved exclusively by
means of capitalist products, i.e. its own means of production
and subsistence. (3) The limits of this expansion are each time
determined in advance by the amount of surplus value which is
to be capitalised in any given case; they cannot be extended,
since they depend on the amount of the means of production
and subsistence which make up the surplus product; neither can
they be reduced, since a part of the surplus value could not then
be employed in its natural form. Deviations in either direction
(above and below) may give rise to periodical fluctuations and
crises&mdash;in this context, however, these may be ignored, because
in general the surplus product to be capitalised must be equal
to actual accumulation. (4) Since capitalist production buys up
its entire surplus product, there is no limit to the accumulation
of capital.</p>

<p>Marx&#8217;s diagram of enlarged reproduction adheres to these
conditions. Accumulation here takes its course, but it is not in
the least indicated who is to benefit by it, who are the new
consumers for whose sake production is ever more enlarged.
The diagram assumes, say, the following course of events: the
coal industry is expanded in order to expand the iron industry
in order to expand the machine industry in order to expand the
production of consumer goods. This last, in turn, is expanded
to maintain both its own workers and the growing army of coal,
iron and machine operatives. And so on <i>ad infinitum</i>. We are
running in circles, quite in accordance with the theory of Tugan
Baranovski. Considered in isolation, Marx&#8217;s diagram does indeed
permit of such an interpretation since he himself explicitly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
states time and again that he aims at presenting the process of
accumulation of the aggregate capital in a society consisting
solely of capitalists and workers. Passages to this effect can be
found in every volume of <i>Capital</i>.</p>

<p>In volume i, in the very chapter on &#8216;The Conversion of
Surplus-Value into Capital&#8217;, he says:</p>

<p>&#8216;In order to examine the object of our investigation in its
integrity, free from all disturbing subsidiary circumstances, we
must treat the whole world as one nation, and assume that
capitalist production is everywhere established and has possessed
itself of every branch of industry.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>In volume ii, the assumption repeatedly returns; thus in
chapter 17 on &#8216;The Circulation of Surplus-Value&#8217;: &#8216;Now, there
are only two points of departure: The capitalist and the
labourer. All third classes of persons must either receive money
for their services from these two classes, or, to the extent that
they receive it without any equivalent services, they are joint
owners of the surplus-value in the form of rent, interest, etc....
The capitalist class, then, remains the sole point of departure
of the circulation of money.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>Further, in the same chapter &#8216;On the Circulation of Money
in Particular under Assumption of Accumulation&#8217;: &#8216;But the
difficulty arises when we assume, not a partial, but a general
accumulation of money-capital on the part of the capitalist
class. Apart from this class, there is, according to our assumption&mdash;the
general and exclusive domination of capitalist production&mdash;no
other class but the working class.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>And again in chapter 20: &#8216;... there are only two classes in
this case, the working class disposing of their labour-power, and
the capitalist class owning the social means of production and
the money.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>In volume iii, Marx says quite explicitly, when demonstrating
the process of capitalist production as a whole: &#8216;Let us suppose
that the whole society is composed only of industrial capitalists
and wage workers. Let us furthermore make exceptions of
fluctuations of prices which prevent large portions of the total
capital from reproducing themselves under average conditions
and which, owing to the general interrelations of the entire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
process of reproduction, such as are developed particularly by
credit, must always call forth general stoppages of a transient
nature. Let us also make abstraction of the bogus transactions
and speculations, which the credit system favours. In that case,
a crisis could be explained only by a disproportion of production
in various branches, and by a disproportion of the consumption
of the capitalists and the accumulation of their capitals. But as
matters stand, the reproduction of the capitals invested in production
depends largely upon the consuming power of the non-producing
classes; while the consuming power of the labourers
is handicapped partly by the laws of wages, partly by the fact
that it can be exerted only so long as the labourers can be
employed at a profit for the capitalist class.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>This last quotation refers to the question of crises with which
we are not here concerned. It can leave no doubt, however,
that the movement of the total capital, &#8216;as matters stand&#8217;,
depends in Marx&#8217;s view on three categories of consumers only:
the capitalists, the workers and the &#8216;non-productive classes&#8217;, i.e.
the hangers-on of the capitalist class (king, parson, professor,
prostitute, mercenary), of whom he quite rightly disposes in
volume ii as the mere representatives of a derivative purchasing
power, and thus the parasitic joint consumers of the surplus
value or of the wage of labour.</p>

<p>Finally, in <i>Theories of Surplus Value</i>,<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>  Marx formulates his
general presuppositions with regard to accumulation as follows:
&#8216;Here we have only to consider the forms through which capital
passes during the various stages of its development. Thus we do
not set out the actual conditions of the real process of production,
but always assume that the commodity is sold for what it is
worth. We ignore the competition of capitalists and the credit
system; we also leave out of account the actual constitution of
society which never consists exclusively of the classes of workers
and industrial capitalists, and where there is accordingly no
strict division between producers and consumers. The first category
(of consumers, whose revenues are partly of a secondary,
not a primitive nature, derived from profits and the wage of
labour) is much wider than the second category (of producers).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
Therefore the manner in which it spends its income, and the
extent of such income, effects very large modifications in the
economic household, and especially so in the process of circulation
and reproduction of capital.&#8217;</p>

<p>Speaking of the &#8216;actual constitution of society&#8217;, Marx here
also considers merely the parasitic joint consumers of surplus
value and of the wage of labour, i.e. only the hangers-on of the
principal categories of capitalist production.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt, therefore, that Marx wanted to
demonstrate the process of accumulation in a society consisting
exclusively of workers and capitalists, under the universal and
exclusive domination of the capitalist mode of production. On
this assumption, however, his diagram does not permit of any
other interpretation than that of production for production&#8217;s
sake.</p>

<p>Let us recall the second example of Marx&#8217;s diagram of
enlarged reproduction:</p>

<p>Here accumulation continues year after year without interruption,
the capitalists in each case consuming half of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
surplus value they have gained and capitalising the other half.
In the process of capitalisation, the same technical foundation,
that is to say the same organic composition or division into constant
and variable capital and also the same rate of exploitation
(always amounting to 100 per cent) is consecutively maintained
for the additional capital as it was for the original capital. In
accordance with Marx&#8217;s assumption in volume i of <i>Capital</i>, the
capitalised part of the surplus value first comes into being as
additional means of production and as means of subsistence for
the workers, both serving the purpose of an ever expanding
production in the two departments. It cannot be discovered
from the assumptions of Marx&#8217;s diagram for whose sake production
is progressively expanded. Admittedly, production and consumption
increase simultaneously in a society. The consumption
of the capitalists increases (in terms of value, in the first year it
amounts to 500&nbsp;+ 142, in the second year to 542&nbsp;+ 158, in the
third year to 586&nbsp;+ 171, and in the fourth year to 635&nbsp;+ 185);
the consumption of the workers increases as well; the variable
capital increasing year after year in both departments precisely
indicates this growth in terms of value. And yet, the growing
consumption of the capitalists can certainly not be regarded as
the ultimate purpose of accumulation; on the contrary, there
is no accumulation inasmuch as this consumption takes place
and increases; personal consumption of the capitalists must be
regarded as simple reproduction. Rather, the question is: if,
and in so far as, the capitalists do not themselves consume their
products but &#8216;practise abstinence&#8217;, i.e. accumulate, for whose
sake do they produce? Even less can the maintenance of an ever
larger army of workers be the ultimate purpose of continuous
accumulation of capital. From the capitalist&#8217;s point of view, the
consumption of the workers is a consequence of accumulation,
it is never its object or its condition, unless the principles
(foundations) of capitalist production are to be turned upside
down. And in any case, the workers can only consume that part
of the product which corresponds to the variable capital, not a
jot more. Who, then, realises the permanently increasing surplus
value? The diagram answers: the capitalists themselves and they
alone.&mdash;And what do they do with this increasing surplus value?&mdash;The
diagram replies: They use it for an ever greater expansion
of their production. These capitalists are thus fanatical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
supporters of an expansion of production for production&#8217;s sake.
They see to it that ever more machines are built for the sake of
building&mdash;with their help&mdash;ever more new machines. Yet the
upshot of all this is not accumulation of capital but an increasing
production of producer goods to no purpose whatever. Indeed,
one must be as reckless as Tugan Baranovski, and rejoice as
much in paradoxical statements, to assume that this untiring
merry-go-round in thin air could be a faithful reflection in
theory of capitalist reality, a true deduction from Marx&#8217;s
doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>Besides the analysis of enlarged reproduction roughed out in
<i>Capital</i>, volume ii, the whole of Marx&#8217;s work, volume ii in particular,
contains a most elaborate and lucid exposition of his
general views regarding the typical course of capitalist accumulation.
If we once fully understand this interpretation, the
deficiencies of the diagram at the end of volume ii are immediately
evident.</p>

<p>If we examine critically the diagram of enlarged reproduction
in the light of Marx&#8217;s theory, we find various contradictions
between the two.</p>

<p>To begin with, the diagram completely disregards the increasing
productivity of labour. For it assumes that the composition
of capital is the same in every year, that is to say, the
technical basis of the productive process is not affected by
accumulation. This procedure would be quite permissible in
itself in order to simplify the analysis, but when we come to
examine the concrete conditions for the realisation of the aggregate
product, and for reproduction, then at least we must take
into account, and make allowance for, changes in technique
which are bound up with the process of capital accumulation.
Yet if we allow for improved productivity of labour, the material
aggregate of the social product&mdash;both producer and consumer
goods&mdash;will in consequence show a much more rapid increase
in volume than is set forth in the diagram. This increase in the
aggregate of use-values, moreover, indicates also a change in
the value relationships. As Marx argues so convincingly, basing
his whole theory on this axiom, the progressive development of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
labour productivity reacts on both the composition of accumulating
capital and the rate of surplus value so that they cannot
remain constant under conditions of increasing accumulation
of capital, as was assumed by the diagram. Rather, if accumulation
continues, <i>c</i>, the constant capital of both departments,
must increase not only absolutely but also relatively to <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>c</i> or
the total new value (the social aspect of labour productivity);
at the same time, constant capital and similarly the surplus
value must increase relatively to the variable capital&mdash;in short,
the rate of surplus value, i.e. the ratio between surplus value
and variable capital, must similarly increase (the capitalist
aspect of labour productivity). These changes need not, of
course, occur annually, just as the terms of first, second and third
year in Marx&#8217;s diagram do not necessarily refer to calendar
years but may stand for any given period. Finally, we may
choose to assume that these alterations, both in the composition
of capital and in the rate of surplus value, take place either in
the first, third, fifth, seventh year, etc., or in the second, sixth
and ninth year, etc. The important thing is only that they are
allowed for somewhere and taken into account as periodical
phenomena. If the diagram is amended accordingly, the result
of this method of accumulation will be an increasing annual
surplus in the consumer at the expense of producer goods. It is
true that Tugan Baranovski conquers all difficulties on paper:
he simply constructs a diagram with different proportions where
year by year the variable capital decreases by 25 per cent. And
since this arithmetical exercise is successful enough on paper,
Tugan triumphantly claims to have &#8216;proved&#8217; that accumulation
runs smoothly like clockwork, even if the absolute volume of
consumption decreases. Even he must admit in the end, however,
that his assumption of such an absolute decrease of the
variable capital is in striking contrast to reality. Variable capital
is in point of fact a growing quantity in all capitalist countries;
only in relation to the even more rapid growth of constant
capital can it be said to decrease. On the basis of what is actually
happening, namely a greater yearly increase of constant capital
as against that of variable capital, as well as a growing rate of
surplus value, discrepancies must arise between the material
composition of the social product and the composition of capital
in terms of value. If, instead of the unchanging proportion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
5 to 1 between constant and variable capital, proposed by
Marx&#8217;s diagram, we assume for instance that this increase of
capital is accompanied by a progressive readjustment of its composition,
the proportion between constant and variable in the
second year being 6 to 1, in the third year 7 to 1, and in the
fourth year 8 to 1&mdash;if we further assume that the rate of surplus
value also increases progressively in accordance with the higher
productivity of labour so that, in each case, we have the same
amounts as those of the diagram, although, because of the relatively
decreasing variable capital, the rate of surplus value does
not remain constant at the original 100 per cent&mdash;and if finally
we assume that one-half of the appropriated surplus value is
capitalised in each case (excepting Department II where capitalisation
exceeds 50 per cent, 184 out of 285 being capitalised
during the first year), the result will be as follows:</p>

<p>If this were a true picture of the accumulative process, the
means of production (constant capital) would show a deficit of
16 in the second year, of 45 in the third year and of 88 in the
fourth year; similarly, the means of subsistence would show a
surplus of 16 in the second year, of 45 in the third year and of
88 in the fourth year.</p>

<p>This negative balance for the means of production may be
only imaginary in part. The increasing productivity of labour
ensures that the means of production grow faster in bulk than
in value, in other words: means of production become cheaper.
As it is use value, i.e. the material elements of capital, which is
relevant for technical improvements of production, we may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
assume that the quantity of means of production, in spite of
their lower value, will suffice for progressive accumulation up
to a certain point. This phenomenon amongst others also checks
the actual decline of the rate of profit and modifies it to a mere
tendency, though our example shows that the decline of the
profit rate would not only be retarded but rather completely
arrested. On the other hand, the same fact indicates a much
larger surplus of unsaleable means of subsistence than is suggested
by the amount of this surplus in terms of value. In that
case, we should have to compel the capitalists of Department II
to consume this surplus themselves, which Marx makes them
do on other occasions; in which case, and in so far as those
capitalists are concerned, there would again be no accumulation
but rather simple reproduction. Alternatively, we should have
to pronounce this whole surplus unsaleable.</p>

<p>Yet would it not be very easy to make good this loss in means
of production which results from our example? We need only
assume that the capitalists of Department I capitalise their
surplus value to a greater extent. Indeed, there is no valid
reason to suppose, as Marx did, that the capitalists in each case
add only half their surplus value to their capital. Advances in
labour productivity may well lead to progressively increasing
capitalisation of surplus value. This assumption is the more permissible
in that the cheapening of consumer goods for the capitalist
class, too, is one of the consequences of technological
progress. The relative decrease in the value of consumable
income (as compared with the capitalised part) may then permit
of the same or even a higher standard of living for this class.
We might for instance make good the deficit in producer goods
by transferring a corresponding part of surplus value I to the
constant capital of this department, a part which would otherwise
be consumed, since this surplus value, like all other products
of the department, originally takes the form of producer
goods; <span class="fraction" title="11 and 4 sevenths">11<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub></span> would then be transferred in the second year, 34 in
the third year and 66 in the fourth year.<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>  The solution of one
difficulty, however, only adds to another. It goes without saying
that if the capitalists of Department I relatively restrict their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
consumption for purposes of accumulation, there will be a proportionately
greater unsaleable residue of consumer goods in
Department II; and thus it becomes more and more impossible
to enlarge the constant capital even on its previous technological
basis. If the capitalists in Department I relatively restrict their
consumption, the capitalists of Department II must relatively
expand their personal consumption in proportion. The assumption
of accelerated accumulation in Department I would then
have to be supplemented by that of retarded accumulation in
Department II, technical progress in one department by regression
in the other.</p>

<p>These results are not due to mere chance. The adjustments we
have tried out on Marx&#8217;s diagram are merely meant to illustrate
that technical progress, as he himself admits, must be accompanied
by a relative growth of constant as against variable
capital. Hence the necessity for a continuous revision of the ratio
in which capitalised surplus value should be allotted to <i>c</i> and <i>v</i>
respectively. In Marx&#8217;s diagram, however, the capitalists are in
no position to make these allocations at will, since the material
form of their surplus value predetermines the forms of capitalisation.
Since, according to Marx&#8217;s assumption, all expansion of
production proceeds exclusively by means of its own, capitalistically
produced means of production and subsistence,&mdash;since
there are here no other places and forms of production and
equally no other consumers than the two departments with
their capitalists and workers,&mdash;and since, on the other hand, the
smooth working of the accumulative process depends on that
circulation should wholly absorb the aggregate product of both
departments, the technological shape of enlarged reproduction
is in consequence strictly prescribed by the material form of the
surplus product. In other words: according to Marx&#8217;s diagram,
the technical organisation of expanded production can and must
be such as to make use of the aggregate surplus value produced
in Departments I and II. In this connection we must bear in
mind also that both departments can obtain their respective
elements of production only by means of mutual exchange.
Thus the allocation to constant or variable capital of the surplus
value earmarked for capitalisation, as well as the allotment of
the additional means of production and subsistence (for the
workers) to Departments I and II is given in advance and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
determined by the relations between the two departments of
the diagram&mdash;both in material and in terms of value. These
relations themselves, however, reflect a quite determinate
technical organisation of production. This implies that, on the
assumptions of Marx&#8217;s diagram, the techniques of production
given in each case predetermine the techniques of the subsequent
periods of enlarged reproduction, if accumulation continues.
Assuming, that is to say, in accordance with Marx&#8217;s
diagram, that the expansion of capitalist production is always
performed by means of the surplus value originally produced
in form of capital, and further&mdash;or rather, conversely&mdash;that
accumulation in one department is strictly dependent on accumulation
in the other, then no change in the technical organisation
of production can be possible in so far as the relation of <i>c</i> to
<i>v</i> is concerned.</p>

<p>We may put our point in yet another way: it is clear that a
quicker growth of constant as compared with variable capital,
i.e. the progressive metamorphosis of the organic composition of
capital, must take the material form of faster expansion of production
in Department I as against production in Department
II. Yet Marx&#8217;s diagram, where strict conformity of the
two departments is axiomatic, precludes any such fluctuations
in the rate of accumulation in either department. It is quite
legitimate to suppose that under the technical conditions of
progressive accumulation, society would invest ever increasing
portions of the surplus value earmarked for accumulation in
Department I rather than in Department II. Both departments
being only branches of the same social production&mdash;supplementary
enterprises, if you like, of the &#8216;aggregate capitalist&#8217;,&mdash;such
a progressive transfer, for technical reasons, from one
department to the other of a part of the accumulated surplus
value would be wholly feasible, especially as it corresponds to
the actual practice of capital. Yet this assumption is possible
only so long as we envisage the surplus value earmarked for
capitalisation purely in terms of value. The diagram, however,
implies that this part of the surplus value appears in a
definite material form which prescribes its capitalisation. Thus
the surplus value of Department II exists as means of subsistence,
and since it is as such to be only realised by Department I,
this intended transfer of part of the capitalised surplus value
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
from Department II to Department I is ruled out, first because
the material form of this surplus value is obviously useless to
Department I, and secondly because of the relations of exchange
between the two departments which would in turn necessitate
an equivalent transfer of the products of Department I into
Department II. It is therefore downright impossible to achieve
a faster expansion of Department I as against Department II
within the limits of Marx&#8217;s diagram.</p>

<p>However we may regard the technological alterations of the
mode of production in the course of accumulation, they cannot
be accomplished without upsetting the fundamental relations of
Marx&#8217;s diagram.</p>

<p>And further: according to Marx&#8217;s diagram, the capitalised
surplus value is in each case immediately and completely
absorbed by the productive process of the following period, for,
apart from the portion earmarked for consumption, it has a
natural form which allows of only one particular kind of employment.
The diagram precludes the cashing and hoarding of
surplus value in monetary form, as capital waiting to be invested.
The free monetary forms of private capital, in Marx&#8217;s
view, are first the money deposited gradually against the wear
and tear of the fixed capital, for its eventual renewal; and
secondly those amounts of money which represent realised
surplus value but are still too small for investment. From the
point of view of the aggregate capital, both these sources of free
money capital are negligible. For if we assume that even a
portion of the social surplus value is realised in monetary form
for purposes of future investment, then at once the question
arises: who has bought the material items of this surplus value,
and who has provided the money? If the answer is: other capitalists,
of course,&mdash;then, seeing that the capitalist class is represented
in the diagram by the two departments, this portion of
the surplus value must also be regarded as invested <i>de facto</i>, as
employed in the productive process. And so we are back at
immediate and complete investment of the surplus value.</p>

<p>Or does the freezing of one part of the surplus value in monetary
form in the hands of certain capitalists mean that other
capitalists will be left with a corresponding part of that surplus
product in its material form? does the hoarding of realised
surplus value by some imply that others are no longer able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
realise their surplus value, since the capitalists are the only
buyers of surplus value? This would mean, however, that the
smooth course of reproduction and similarly of accumulation
as described in the diagram would be interrupted. The result
would be a crisis, due not to over-production but to a
mere intention to accumulate, the kind of crisis envisaged by
Sismondi.</p>

<p>In one passage of his <i>Theories</i>,<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>  Marx explains in so many
words that he &#8216;is not at all concerned in this connection with an
accumulation of capital greater than can be used in the productive
process and might lie idle in the banks in monetary form,
with the consequence of lending abroad&#8217;. Marx refers these
phenomena to the section on competition. Yet it is important to
establish that his diagram veritably precludes the formation of
such additional capital. Competition, however wide we may
make the concept, obviously cannot create values, nor can it
create capitals which are not themselves the result of the reproductive
process.</p>

<p>The diagram thus precludes the expansion of production by
leaps and bounds. It only allows of a gradual expansion which
keeps strictly in step with the formation of the surplus value and
is based upon the identity between realisation and capitalisation
of the surplus value.</p>

<p>For the same reason, the diagram presumes an accumulation
which affects both departments equally and therefore all
branches of capitalist production. It precludes expansion of the
demand by leaps and bounds just as much as it prevents a one-sided
or precocious development of individual branches of
capitalist production.</p>

<p>Thus the diagram assumes a movement of the aggregate
capital which flies in the face of the actual course of capitalist
development. At first sight, two facts are typical for the history
of the capitalist mode of production: on the one hand the
periodical expansion of the whole field of production by leaps
and bounds, and on the other an extremely unequal development
of the different branches of production. The history of the
English cotton industry from the first quarter of the eighteenth
to the seventies of the nineteenth century, the most characteristic
chapter in the history of the capitalist mode of production,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
appears quite inexplicable from the point of view of Marx&#8217;s
diagram.</p>

<p>Finally, the diagram contradicts the conception of the capitalist
total process and its course as laid down by Marx in
<i>Capital</i>, volume iii. This conception is based on the inherent
contradiction between the unlimited expansive capacity of the
productive forces and the limited expansive capacity of social
consumption under conditions of capitalist distribution. Let us
see how Marx describes this contradiction in detail in chapter 15
on &#8216;Unravelling the Internal Contradictions of the Law&#8217; (of the
declining profit rate):</p>

<p>&#8216;The creation of surplus-value, assuming the necessary means
of production, or sufficient accumulation of capital, to be existing,
finds no other limit but the labouring population, when the
rate of surplus-value, that is, the intensity of exploitation, is
given; and no other limit but the intensity of exploitation, when
the labouring population is given. And the capitalist process of
production consists essentially of the production of surplus-value,
materialised in the surplus-product, which is that aliquot portion
of the produced commodities, in which unpaid labour is materialised.
It must never be forgotten, that the production of this
surplus-value&mdash;and the re-conversion of a portion of it into
capital, or accumulation, forms an indispensable part of this
production of surplus-value&mdash;is the immediate purpose and the
compelling motive of capitalist production. It will not do to
represent capitalist production as something which it is not, that
is to say, as a production having for its immediate purpose the
consumption of goods, or the production of means of enjoyment
for the capitalists. (And, of course, even less for the worker.
R. L.) This would be overlooking the specific character of
capitalist production, which reveals itself in its innermost
essence. The creation of this surplus-value is the object of the
direct process of production, and this process has no other limits
than those mentioned above. As soon as the available quantity
of surplus-value has been materialised in commodities, surplus-value
has been produced. But this production of surplus-value
is but the first act of the capitalist process of production, it
merely terminates the act of direct production. Capital has
absorbed so much unpaid labour. With the development of the
process, which expresses itself through a falling tendency of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
rate of profit, the mass of surplus-value thus produced is swelled
to immense dimensions. Now comes the second act of the
process. The entire mass of commodities, the total product,
which contains a portion which is to reproduce the constant and
variable capital as well as a portion representing surplus-value,
must be sold. If this is not done, or only partly accomplished, or
only at prices which are below the prices of production, the
labourer has been none the less exploited, but his exploitation
does not realise as much for the capitalist. It may yield no
surplus-value at all for him, or only realise a portion of the produced
surplus-value, or it may even mean a partial or complete
loss of his capital. The conditions of direct exploitation and
those of the realisation of surplus-value are not identical. They
are separated logically as well as by time and space. The first
are only limited by the productive power of society, the last by
the proportional relations of the various lines of production and
by the consuming power of society. This last-named power is not
determined either by the absolute productive power or by the
absolute consuming power, but by the consuming power based
on antagonistic conditions of distribution, which reduces the
consumption of the great mass of the population to a variable
minimum within more or less narrow limits. The consuming
power is furthermore restricted by the tendency to accumulate,
the greed for an expansion of capital and a production of surplus-value
on an enlarged scale. This is a law of capitalist production
imposed by incessant revolutions in the methods of production
themselves, the resulting depreciation of existing capital, the
general competitive struggle and the necessity of improving the
product and expanding the scale of production, for the sake of
self-preservation and on penalty of failure. The market must,
therefore, be continually extended, so that its interrelations and
the conditions regulating them assume more and more the form
of a natural law independent of the producers and become ever
more uncontrollable. This eternal contradiction seeks to balance
itself by an expansion of the outlying fields of production. But
to the extent that the productive power develops, it finds itself
at variance with the narrow basis on which the conditions of
consumption rest. On this self-contradictory basis it is no contradiction
at all that there should be an excess of capital simultaneously
with an excess of population. For while a combination of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
these two would indeed increase the mass of the produced
surplus-value, it would at the same time intensify the contradiction
between the conditions under which this surplus-value is
produced and those under which it is realised.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>If we compare this description with the diagram of enlarged
reproduction, the two are by no means in conformity. According
to the diagram, there is no inherent contradiction between
the production of the surplus value and its realisation, rather,
the two are identical. The surplus value here from the very
beginning comes into being in a natural form exclusively
designed for the requirements of accumulation. In fact it leaves
the place of production in the very form of additional capital,
that is to say it is capable of realisation in the capitalist process
of accumulation. The capitalists, as a class, see to it in advance
that the surplus value they appropriate is produced entirely in
that material form which will permit and ensure its employment
for purposes of further accumulation. Realisation and accumulation
of the surplus value here are both aspects of the same
process, they are logically identical. Therefore according to the
presentation of the reproductive process in the diagram, society&#8217;s
capacity to consume does not put a limit to production. Here
production automatically expands year by year, although the
capacity of society for consumption has not gone beyond its
&#8216;antagonistic conditions of distribution&#8217;. This automatic continuation
of expansion, of accumulation, truly is the &#8216;law of
capitalist production ... on penalty of failure&#8217;. Yet according
to the analysis in volume iii, &#8216;the market must, therefore, be
continually extended&#8217;, &#8216;the market&#8217; obviously transcending the
consumption of capitalists and workers. And if Tugan Baranovski
interprets the following passage &#8216;this eternal contradiction
seeks to balance itself by an expansion of the outlying fields of
production&#8217; as if Marx had meant production itself by &#8216;outlying
fields of production&#8217;, he violates not only the spirit of the
language but also Marx&#8217;s clear train of thought. The &#8216;outlying
fields of production&#8217; are clearly and unequivocally not production
itself but consumption which &#8216;must be continually extended&#8217;.
The following passage in <i>Theorien über den Mehrwert</i>,
amongst others, sufficiently shows that Marx had this in mind
and nothing else: &#8216;Ricardo therefore consistently denies the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
necessity for an <i>expansion of the market</i> to accompany the expansion
of production and the growth of capital. The entire capital
existing within a country can also be profitably used in that
country. He therefore argues against Adam Smith who had set
up his (Ricardo&#8217;s) opinion on the one hand but also contradicted
it with his usual sure instinct.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>In yet another passage, Marx clearly shows that Tugan
Baranovski&#8217;s notion of production for production&#8217;s sake is wholly
alien to him: &#8216;Besides, we have seen in volume ii part iii that
a continuous circulation takes place between constant capital
and constant capital (even without considering any accelerated
accumulation), which is in so far independent of individual
consumption, as it never enters into such consumption, but
which is nevertheless definitely limited by it, because the production
of constant capital never takes place for its own sake,
but solely because more of this capital is needed in those
spheres of production whose products pass into individual
consumption.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>Admittedly, in the diagram in volume ii, Tugan Baranovski&#8217;s
sole support, market and production coincide&mdash;they are one
and the same. Expansion of the market here means extended
production, since production is said to be its own exclusive
market&mdash;the consumption of the workers being an element of
production, i.e. the reproduction of variable capital. Therefore
the limit for both the expansion of production and the extension
of the market is one and the same: it is given by the volume of
the social capital, or the stage of accumulation already attained.
The greater the quantity of surplus value that has been extracted
in the natural form of capital, the more can be accumulated;
and the greater the volume of accumulation, the more
surplus value can be invested in its material form of capital, i.e.
the more can be realised. Thus the diagram does not admit the
contradiction outlined in the analysis of volume iii. In the
process described by the diagram there is no need for a continual
extension of the market beyond the consumption of capitalists
and workers, nor is the limited social capacity for consumption
an obstacle to the smooth course of production and its unlimited
capacity for expansion. The diagram does indeed permit of
crises but only because of a lack of proportion within production,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
because of a defective social control over the productive
process. It precludes, however, the deep and fundamental
antagonism between the capacity to consume and the capacity to
produce in a capitalist society, a conflict resulting from the very
accumulation of capital which periodically bursts out in crises
and spurs capital on to a continual extension of the market.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXVI</i></h2>

<h2>THE REPRODUCTION OF CAPITAL
AND ITS SOCIAL SETTING</h2>

<p>Marx&#8217;s diagram of enlarged reproduction cannot explain
the actual and historical process of accumulation.
And why? Because of the very premises of the diagram.
The diagram sets out to describe the accumulative process on
the assumption that the capitalists and workers are the sole
agents of capitalist consumption. We have seen that Marx consistently
and deliberately assumes the universal and exclusive
domination of the capitalist mode of production as a theoretical
premise of his analysis in all three volumes of <i>Capital</i>. Under
these conditions, there can admittedly be no other classes of
society than capitalists and workers; as the diagram has it, all
&#8216;third persons&#8217; of capitalist society&mdash;civil servants, the liberal
professions, the clergy, etc.&mdash;must, as consumers, be counted in
with these two classes, and preferably with the capitalist class.
This axiom, however, is a theoretical contrivance&mdash;real life has
never known a self-sufficient capitalist society under the exclusive
domination of the capitalist mode of production. This
theoretical device is perfectly admissible so long as it merely
helps to demonstrate the problem in its integrity and does not
interfere with its very conditions. A case in point is the analysis
of simple reproduction of the aggregate social capital, where the
problem itself rests upon a fiction: in a society producing by
capitalist methods, i.e. a society which creates surplus value, the
whole of the latter is taken to be consumed by the capitalists
who appropriate it. The object is to present the forms of social
production and reproduction under these given conditions. Here
the very formulation of the problem implies that production
knows no other consumers than capitalists and workers and thus
strictly conforms to Marx&#8217;s premise: universal and exclusive
domination of the capitalist mode of production. The implications
of both fictions are the same. Similarly, it is quite legitimate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
to postulate absolute dominance of capital in an analysis of the
accumulation of individual capitals, such as is given in <i>Capital</i>,
volume i. The reproduction of individual capitals is an element
in total social reproduction but one which follows an independent
course, contrary to the movements of the other elements.
In consequence it will not do simply to take together the individual
movements of the respective capitals in order to arrive at
the total movement of social capital, since the latter is essentially
different. The natural conditions of reproducing individual
capitals therefore neither conform with one another, nor do they
conform to the relations of the total capital. Under normal
conditions of circulation, every individual capital engages in
the process of circulation and of accumulation entirely on its
own account, depending upon others only in so far, of course,
as it is compelled to find a market for its product and must
find available the means of production it requires for its specific
activities. Whether the strata who afford this market and provide
the necessary means of production are themselves capitalist
producers or not is completely immaterial for the individual
capital, although, in theory, the most favourable premise for
analysing the accumulation of individual capital is the assumption
that capitalist production has attained universal and exclusive
domination and is the sole setting of this process.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>Now, however, the question arises whether the assumptions
which were decisive in the case of individual capital, are also
legitimate for the consideration of aggregate capital.</p>

<p>&#8216;We must now put the problem in this form: <i>given universal
accumulation</i>, that is to say provided that in all branches of production
there is greater or less accumulation of capital&mdash;which
in fact is a condition of capitalist production, and which is just
as natural to the capitalist <i>qua</i> capitalist as it is natural to the
miser to amass money (but which is also necessary for the perpetuation
of capitalist production)&mdash;what are the <i>conditions</i> of
this universal accumulation, to what elements can it be reduced?&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
And the answer: &#8216;<i>The conditions for the accumulation of capital are
precisely those which rule its original production and reproduction in
general</i>: these conditions being that one part of the money buys
labour and the other commodities (raw materials, machinery,
etc.) ... Accumulation of new capital can only proceed therefore
under the same conditions under which already existing
capital is reproduced.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>In real life the actual conditions for the accumulation of the
aggregate capital are quite different from those prevailing for
individual capitals and for simple reproduction. The problem
amounts to this: If an increasing part of the surplus value is not
consumed by the capitalists but employed in the expansion of
production, what, then, are the forms of social reproduction?
What is left of the social product after deductions for the replacement
of the constant capital cannot, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, be absorbed
by the consumption of the workers and capitalists&mdash;this being
the main aspect of the problem&mdash;nor can the workers and
capitalists themselves realise the aggregate product. They can
always only realise the variable capital, that part of the constant
capital which will be used up, and the part of the surplus value
which will be consumed, but in this way they merely ensure that
production can be renewed on its previous scale. The workers
and capitalists themselves cannot possibly realise that part of
the surplus value which is to be capitalised. Therefore, the
realisation of the surplus value for the purposes of accumulation
is an impossible task for a society which consists solely of workers
and capitalists. Strangely enough, all theorists who analysed
the problem of accumulation, from Ricardo and Sismondi to
Marx, started with the very assumption which makes their
problem insoluble. A sure instinct that realisation of the surplus
value requires &#8216;third persons&#8217;, that is to say consumers other
than the immediate agents of capitalist production (i.e. workers
and capitalists) led to all kinds of subterfuges: &#8216;unproductive
consumption&#8217; as presented by Malthus in the person of the
feudal landowner, by Vorontsov in militarism, by Struve in the
&#8216;liberal professions&#8217; and other hangers-on of the capitalist class;
or else foreign trade is brought into play which proved a useful
safety valve to all those who regarded accumulation with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
scepticism, from Sismondi to Nicolayon. Because of these insoluble
difficulties, others like v. Kirchmann and Rodbertus
tried to do without accumulation altogether, or, like Sismondi
and his Russian &#8216;populist&#8217; followers, stressed the need for
at least putting the dampers on accumulation as much as
possible.</p>

<p>The salient feature of the problem of accumulation, and the
vulnerable point of earlier attempts to solve it, has only been
shown up by Marx&#8217;s more profound analysis, his precise diagrammatic
demonstration of the total reproductive process, and
especially his inspired exposition of the problem of simple reproduction.
Yet he could not supply immediately a finished solution
either, partly because he broke off his analysis almost as soon as
he had begun it, and partly because he was then preoccupied,
as we have shown, with denouncing the analysis of Adam Smith
and thus rather lost sight of the main problem. In fact, he made
the solution even more difficult by assuming the capitalist mode
of production to prevail universally. Nevertheless, a solution of
the problem of accumulation, in harmony both with other parts
of Marx&#8217;s doctrine and with the historical experience and daily
practice of capitalism, is implied in Marx&#8217;s complete analysis of
simple reproduction and his characterisation of the capitalist
process as a whole which shows up its immanent contradictions
and their development (in <i>Capital</i>, vol. iii). In the light of this,
the deficiencies of the diagram can be corrected. All the relations
being, as it were, incomplete, a closer study of the
diagram of enlarged reproduction will reveal that it points to
some sort of organisation more advanced than purely capitalist
production and accumulation.</p>

<p>Up to now we have only considered one aspect of enlarged
reproduction, the problem of realising the surplus value, whose
difficulties hitherto had claimed the sceptics&#8217; whole attention.
Realisation of the surplus value is doubtless a vital question of
capitalist accumulation. It requires as its prime condition&mdash;ignoring,
for simplicity&#8217;s sake, the capitalists&#8217; fund of consumption
altogether&mdash;that there should be strata of buyers outside
capitalist society. Buyers, it should be noted, not consumers,
since the material form of the surplus value is quite irrelevant to
its realisation. The decisive fact is that the surplus value cannot
be realised by sale either to workers or to capitalists, but only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
if it is sold to such social organisations or strata whose own
mode of production is not capitalistic. Here we can conceive
of two different cases:</p>

<p>(1) Capitalist production supplies consumer goods over and
above its own requirements, the demand of its workers and
capitalists, which are bought by non-capitalist strata and
countries. The English cotton industry, for instance, during the
first two-thirds of the nineteenth century, and to some extent
even now, has been supplying cotton textiles to the peasants
and petty-bourgeois townspeople of the European continent,
and to the peasants of India, America, Africa and so on. The
enormous expansion of the English cotton industry was thus
founded on consumption by non-capitalist strata and countries.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>
In England herself, this flourishing cotton industry called forth
large-scale development in the production of industrial machinery
(bobbins and weaving-looms), and further in the metal
and coal industries and so on. In this instance, Department II
realised its products to an increasing extent by sale to non-capitalist
social strata, and by its own accumulation it created
on its part an increasing demand for the home produce of
Department I, thus helping the latter to realise its surplus value
and to increase its own accumulation.</p>

<p>(2) Conversely, capitalist production supplies means of production
in excess of its own demand and finds buyers in non-capitalist
countries. English industry, for instance, in the first
half of the nineteenth century supplied materials for the construction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
of railroads in the American and Australian states.
(The building of railways cannot in itself be taken as evidence
for the domination of capitalist production in a country. As a
matter of fact, the railways in this case provided only one of the
first conditions for the inauguration of capitalist production.)
Another example would be the German chemical industry
which supplies means of production such as dyes in great
quantities to Asiatic, African and other countries whose own
production is not capitalistic.<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>  Here Department I realises its
products in extra-capitalist circles. The resulting progressive
expansion of Department I gives rise to a corresponding expansion
of Department II in the same (capitalistically producing)
country in order to supply the means of subsistence for the
growing army of workers in Department I.</p>

<p>Each of these cases differs from Marx&#8217;s diagram. In one case,
the product of Department II exceeds the needs of both departments,
measured by the variable capital and the consumed part
of the surplus value. In the second case, the product of Department
I exceeds the volume of constant capital in both departments,
enlarged though it is for the purpose of expanding
production. In both cases, the surplus value does not come into
being in that natural form which would make its capitalisation
in either department possible and necessary. These two prototypes
continually overlap in real life, supplement each other and
merge.</p>

<p>In this contest, one point seems still obscure. The surplus
of consumer goods, say cotton fabrics, which is sold to non-capitalist
countries, does not exclusively represent surplus value,
but, as a capitalist commodity, it embodies also constant and
variable capital. It seems quite arbitrary to assume that just
those commodities which are sold outside the capitalist strata
of society should represent nothing but surplus value. On the
other hand, Department I clearly can in this case not only
realise its surplus value but also accumulate, and that without
requiring another market for its product than the two departments
of capitalist production. Yet both these objections are
only apparent. All we need remember is that each component
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
of the aggregate product represents a proportion of the total
value, that under conditions of capitalist production not only the
aggregate product but every single commodity contains surplus
value; which consideration does not prevent the individual
capitalist, however, from computing that the sale of his specific
commodities must first reimburse him for his outlay on constant
capital and secondly replace his variable capital (or, rather
loosely, but in accordance with actual practice: it must first
replace his fixed, and then his circulating capital); what then
remains will go down as profit. Similarly, we can divide the
aggregate social product into three proportionate parts which,
in terms of value, correspond to (1) the constant capital that has
been used up in society, (2) the variable capital, and (3) the
extracted surplus value. In the case of simple reproduction these
proportions are also reflected in the material shape of the
aggregate product: the constant capital materialises as means
of production, the variable capital as means of subsistence for
the workers, and the surplus value as means of subsistence for
the capitalist. Yet as we know, the concept of simple reproduction
with consumption of the entire surplus value by the
capitalists is a mere fiction. As for enlarged reproduction or
accumulation, in Marx&#8217;s diagram the composition of the social
product in terms of value is also strictly in proportion to its
material form: the surplus value, or rather that part of it which
is earmarked for capitalisation, has from the very beginning the
form of material means of production and means of subsistence
for the workers in a ratio appropriate to the expansion of production
on a given technical basis. As we have seen, this conception,
which is based upon the self-sufficiency and isolation of
capitalist production, falls down as soon as we consider the
realisation of the surplus value. If we assume, however, that the
surplus value is realised outside the sphere of capitalist production,
then its material form is independent of the requirements
of capitalist production itself. Its material form conforms
to the requirements of those non-capitalist circles who help to
realise it, that is to say, capitalist surplus value can take the
form of consumer goods, e.g. cotton fabrics, or of means of
production, e.g. materials for railway construction, as the case
may be. If one department realises its surplus value by exporting
its products, and with the ensuing expansion of production
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
helps the other department to realise its surplus value on the
home market, then the fact still remains that the <i>social</i> surplus
value must yet be taken as realised outside the two departments,
either mediately or immediately. Similar considerations enable
the individual capitalist to realise his surplus value, even if the
whole of his commodities can only replace either the variable or
the constant capital of another capitalist.</p>

<p>Nor is the realisation of the surplus value the only vital aspect
of reproduction. Given that Department I has disposed of its
surplus value outside, thereby starting the process of accumulation,
and further, that it can expect a new increase in the
demand in non-capitalist circles, these two conditions add up to
only half of what is required for accumulation. There is many
a slip &#8217;twixt the cup and the lip. The second requirement of
accumulation is access to material elements necessary for expanding
reproduction. Seeing that we have just turned the
surplus product of Department I into money by getting rid of
the surplus means of production to non-capitalist circles, from
where are these material elements then to come? The transaction
which is the portal for realising the surplus value is also,
as it were, a backdoor out of which flies all possibility of converting
this realised surplus value into productive capital&mdash;one
leads to the nether regions and the other to the deep sea. Let us
take a closer look.</p>

<p>Here we use <i>c</i> in both Departments I and II as if it were the
entire constant capital in production. Yet this we know is
wrong. Only for the sake of simplifying the diagram have we
disregarded that the <i>c</i> which figures in Departments I and II
of the diagram is only part of the aggregate constant capital of
society, that is to say that part which, circulating during one
year, is used up and embodied in the products of one period of
production. Yet it would be perfectly absurd if capitalist production&mdash;or
any other&mdash;would use up its entire constant capital
and create it anew in every period of production. On the contrary,
we assume that the whole mass of means of production,
for the periodical total renewal of which the diagram provides
in annual instalments&mdash;renewal of the used-up part&mdash;lies at
the back of production as presented in the diagram. With progressing
labour productivity and an expanding volume of
production, this mass increases not only absolutely but also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
relatively to the part which is consumed in production in every
case, together with a corresponding increase in the efficiency
of the constant capital. It is the more intensive exploitation of
this part of the constant capital, irrespective of its increase in
value, which is of paramount importance for the expansion of
production.</p>

<p>&#8216;In the extractive industries, mines, etc., the raw materials
form no part of the capital advanced. The subject of labour is
in this case not a product of previous labour, but is furnished
by Nature gratis, as in the case of metals, minerals, coal, stone,
etc. In these cases the constant capital consists almost exclusively
of instruments of labour, which can very well absorb an
increased quantity of labour (day and night shifts of labourers,
e.g.). All other things being equal, the mass and value of the
product will rise in direct proportion to the labour expended.
As on the first day of production, the original produce-formers,
now turned into the creators of the material elements of capital&mdash;man
and Nature&mdash;still work together. Thanks to the elasticity
of labour-power, the domain of accumulation has extended
without any previous enlargement of constant capital.&mdash;In
agriculture the land under cultivation cannot be increased
without the advance of more seed and manure. But this advance
once made, the purely mechanical working of the soil itself
produces a marvellous effect on the amount of the product. A
greater quantity of labour, done by the same number of
labourers as before, thus increases the fertility, without requiring
any new advance in the instruments of labour. It is once again
the direct action of man on Nature which becomes an immediate
source of greater accumulation, without the intervention
of any new capital. Finally, in what is called manufacturing
industry, every additional expenditure of labour presupposes a
corresponding additional expenditure of raw materials, but not
necessarily of instruments of labour. And as extractive industry
and agriculture supply manufacturing industry with its raw
materials and those of its instruments of labour, the additional
product the former have created without additional advance of
capital, tells also in favour of the latter.&mdash;General result: by
incorporating with itself the two primary creators of wealth,
labour-power and the land, capital acquires a power of expansion
that permits it to augment the elements of its accumulation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
beyond the limits apparently fixed by its own magnitude, or
by the value and the mass of the means of production, already
produced, in which it has its being.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>In addition, there is no obvious reason why means of production
and consumer goods should be produced by capitalist
methods alone. This assumption, for all Marx used it as the
corner-stone of his thesis, is in conformity neither with the daily
practice, and the history, of capital, nor with the specific character
of this mode of production. In the first half of the nineteenth
century, a great part of the surplus value in England was
produced in form of cotton fabrics. Yet the material elements
for the capitalisation of this surplus value, although they certainly
represented a surplus product, still were by no means all
capitalist surplus value, to mention only raw cotton from the
slave states of the American Union, or grain (a means of subsistence
for the English workers) from the fields of serf-owning
Russia. How much capitalist accumulation depends upon means
of production which are not produced by capitalist methods is
shown for example by the cotton crisis in England during the
American War of Secession, when the cultivation of the plantations
came to a standstill, or by the crisis of European linen-weaving
during the war in the East, when flax could not be
imported from serf-owning Russia. We need only recall that
imports of corn raised by peasants&mdash;i.e. not produced by capitalist
methods&mdash;played a vital part in the feeding of industrial
labour, as an element, that is to say, of variable capital, for a
further illustration of the close ties between non-capitalist strata
and the material elements necessary to the accumulation of
capital.</p>

<p>Moreover, capitalist production, by its very nature, cannot
be restricted to such means of production as are produced
by capitalist methods. Cheap elements of constant capital are
essential to the individual capitalist who strives to increase his
rate of profit. In addition, the very condition of continuous improvements
in labour productivity as the most important
method of increasing the rate of surplus value, is unrestricted
utilisation of all substances and facilities afforded by nature and
soil. To tolerate any restriction in this respect would be contrary
to the very essence of capital, its whole mode of existence. After
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
many centuries of development, the capitalist mode of production
still constitutes only a fragment of total world production.
Even in the small Continent of Europe, where it now chiefly
prevails, it has not yet succeeded in dominating entire branches
of production, such as peasant agriculture and the independent
handicrafts; the same holds true, further, for large parts of
North America and for a number of regions in the other continents.
In general, capitalist production has hitherto been confined
mainly to the countries in the temperate zone, whilst it
made comparatively little progress in the East, for instance, and
the South. Thus, if it were dependent exclusively on elements
of production obtainable within such narrow limits, its present
level and indeed its development in general would have been
impossible. From the very beginning, the forms and laws of
capitalist production aim to comprise the entire globe as a store
of productive forces. Capital, impelled to appropriate productive
forces for purposes of exploitation, ransacks the whole
world, it procures its means of production from all corners of
the earth, seizing them, if necessary by force, from all levels of
civilisation and from all forms of society. The problem of the
material elements of capitalist accumulation, far from being
solved by the material form of the surplus value that has been
produced, takes on quite a different aspect. It becomes necessary
for capital progressively to dispose ever more fully of the
whole globe, to acquire an unlimited choice of means of production,
with regard to both quality and quantity, so as to find
productive employment for the surplus value it has realised.</p>

<p>The process of accumulation, elastic and spasmodic as it is,
requires inevitably free access to ever new areas of raw materials
in case of need, both when imports from old sources fail or when
social demand suddenly increases. When the War of Secession
interfered with the import of American cotton, causing the
notorious &#8216;cotton famine&#8217; in the Lancashire district, new and
immense cotton plantations sprang up in Egypt almost at once,
as if by magic. Here it was Oriental despotism, combined with
an ancient system of bondage, which had created a sphere of
activity for European capital. Only capital with its technical
resources can effect such a miraculous change in so short a time&mdash;but
only on the pre-capitalist soil of more primitive social
conditions can it develop the ascendancy necessary to achieve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
such miracles. Another example of the same kind is the enormous
increase in the world consumption of rubber which at present
(1912) necessitates a supply of latex to the value of £50,000,000
<i>per annum</i>. The economic basis for the production of raw
materials is a primitive system of exploitation practised by
European capital in the African colonies and in America, where
the institutions of slavery and bondage are combined in various
forms.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>Between the production of surplus value, then, and the subsequent
period of accumulation, two separate transactions take
place&mdash;that of realising the surplus value, i.e. of converting it
into pure value, and that of transforming this pure value into
productive capital. They are both dealings between capitalist
production and the surrounding non-capitalist world. From the
aspect both of realising the surplus value and of procuring the
material elements of constant capital, international trade is a
prime necessity for the historical existence of capitalism&mdash;an
international trade which under actual conditions is essentially
an exchange between capitalistic and non-capitalistic modes of
production.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have considered accumulation solely with regard
to surplus value and constant capital. The third element of
accumulation is variable capital which increases with progressive
accumulation. In Marx&#8217;s diagram, the social product contains
ever more means of subsistence for the workers as the
material form proper to this variable capital. The variable
capital, however, is not really the means of subsistence for the
workers but is in fact living labour for whose reproduction these
means of subsistence are necessary. One of the fundamental
conditions of accumulation is therefore a supply of living labour
which can be mobilised by capital to meet its demands. This
supply can be increased under favourable conditions&mdash;but only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
up to a certain point&mdash;by longer hours and more intensive
work. Both these methods of increasing the supply, however, do
not enlarge the variable capital, or do so only to a small extent
(e.g. payment for overtime). Moreover, they are confined to
definite and rather narrow limits which they cannot exceed
owing to both natural and social causes. The increasing growth
of variable capital which accompanies accumulation must
therefore become manifest in ever greater numbers of employed
labour. Where can this additional labour be found?</p>

<p>In his analysis of the accumulation of individual capital,
Marx gives the following answer: &#8216;Now in order to allow of
these elements actually functioning as capital, the capitalist
class requires additional labour. If the exploitation of the
labourers already employed does not increase, either extensively
or intensively, then additional labour-power must be found. For
this the mechanism of capitalist production provides beforehand,
by converting the working class into a class dependent on
wages, a class whose ordinary wages suffice, not only for its
maintenance, but for its increase. It is only necessary for capital
to incorporate this additional labour-power, annually supplied
by the working class in the shape of labourers of all ages, with
the surplus means of production comprised in the annual
produce, and the conversion of surplus-value into capital is
complete.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
Thus the increase in the variable capital is directly and
exclusively attributed to the natural physical increase of a working
class already dominated by capital. This is in strict conformity
with the diagram of enlarged reproduction which recognises
only the social classes of capitalists and workers, and
regards the capitalist mode of production as exclusive and
absolute. On these assumptions, the natural increase of the
working class is the only source of extending the labour supply
commanded by capital. This view, however, is contrary to the
laws governing the process of accumulation. The natural propagation
of the workers and the requirements of accumulating
capital are not correlative in respect of time or quantity. Marx
himself has most brilliantly shown that natural propagation
cannot keep up with the sudden expansive needs of capital. If
natural propagation were the only foundation for the development
of capital, accumulation, in its periodical swings from
overstrain to exhaustion, could not continue, nor could the productive
sphere expand by leaps and bounds, and accumulation
itself would become impossible. The latter requires an unlimited
freedom of movement in respect of the growth of variable
capital equal to that which it enjoys with regard to the elements
of constant capital&mdash;that is to say it must needs dispose over the
supply of labour power without restriction. Marx considers that
this can be achieved by an &#8216;industrial reserve army of workers&#8217;.
His diagram of simple reproduction admittedly does not recognise
such an army, nor could it have room for it, since the
natural propagation of the capitalist wage proletariat cannot
provide an industrial reserve army. Labour for this army is
recruited from social reservoirs outside the dominion of capital&mdash;it
is drawn into the wage proletariat only if need arises. Only
the existence of non-capitalist groups and countries can guarantee
such a supply of additional labour power for capitalist
production. Yet in his analysis of the industrial reserve army<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>
Marx only allows for (<i>a</i>) the displacement of older workers by
machinery, (<i>b</i>) an influx of rural workers into the towns in
consequence of the ascendancy of capitalist production in agriculture,
(<i>c</i>) occasional labour that has dropped out of industry,
and (<i>d</i>) finally the lowest residue of relative over-population,
the paupers. All these categories are cast off by the capitalist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
system of production in some form or other, they constitute a
wage proletariat that is worn out and made redundant one way
or another. Marx, obviously influenced by English conditions
involving a high level of capitalist development, held that the
rural workers who continually migrate to the towns belong to
the wage proletariat, since they were formerly dominated by
agricultural capital and now become subject to industrial
capital. He ignores, however, the problem which is of paramount
importance for conditions on the continent of Europe,
namely the sources from which this urban and rural proletariat
is recruited: the continual process by which the rural and urban
middle strata become proletarian with the decay of peasant
economy and of small artisan enterprises, the very process, that
is to say, of incessant transition from non-capitalist to capitalist
conditions of a labour power that is cast off by pre-capitalist,
not capitalist, modes of production in their progressive breakdown
and disintegration. Besides the decay of European peasants
and artisans we must here also mention the disintegration of
the most varied primitive forms of production and of social
organisation in non-European countries.</p>

<p>Since capitalist production can develop fully only with complete
access to all territories and climes, it can no more confine
itself to the natural resources and productive forces of the
temperate zone than it can manage with white labour alone.
Capital needs other races to exploit territories where the white
man cannot work. It must be able to mobilise world labour
power without restriction in order to utilise all productive forces
of the globe&mdash;up to the limits imposed by a system of producing
surplus value. This labour power, however, is in most cases
rigidly bound by the traditional pre-capitalist organisation of
production. It must first be &#8216;set free&#8217; in order to be enrolled in
the active army of capital. The emancipation of labour power
from primitive social conditions and its absorption by the capitalist
wage system is one of the indispensable historical bases of
capitalism. For the first genuinely capitalist branch of production,
the English cotton industry, not only the cotton of the
Southern states of the American Union was essential, but also
the millions of African Negroes who were shipped to America to
provide the labour power for the plantations, and who later,
as a free proletariat, were incorporated in the class of wage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
labourers in a capitalist system.<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>  Obtaining the necessary labour
power from non-capitalist societies, the so-called &#8216;labour-problem&#8217;,
is ever more important for capital in the colonies. All
possible methods of &#8216;gentle compulsion&#8217; are applied to solving
this problem, to transfer labour from former social systems to the
command of capital. This endeavour leads to the most peculiar
combinations between the modern wage system and primitive
authority in the colonial countries.<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>  This is a concrete example
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
of the fact that capitalist production cannot manage without
labour power from other social organisations.</p>

<p>Admittedly, Marx dealt in detail with the process of
appropriating non-capitalist means of production as well as
with the transformation of the peasants into a capitalist proletariat.
Chapter xxiv of <i>Capital</i>, vol. i, is devoted to describing
the origin of the English proletariat, of the capitalistic agricultural
tenant class and of industrial capital, with particular
emphasis on the looting of colonial countries by European
capital. Yet we must bear in mind that all this is treated solely
with a view to so-called primitive accumulation. For Marx,
these processes are incidental, illustrating merely the genesis of
capital, its first appearance in the world; they are, as it were,
travails by which the capitalist mode of production emerges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
from a feudal society. As soon as he comes to analyse the capitalist
process of production and circulation, he reaffirms the
universal and exclusive domination of capitalist production.</p>

<p>Yet, as we have seen, capitalism in its full maturity also
depends in all respects on non-capitalist strata and social organisations
existing side by side with it. It is not merely a question of
a market for the additional product, as Sismondi and the later
critics and doubters of capitalist accumulation would have it.
The interrelations of accumulating capital and non-capitalist
forms of production extend over values as well as over material
conditions, for constant capital, variable capital and surplus
value alike. The non-capitalist mode of production is the given
historical setting for this process. Since the accumulation of
capital becomes impossible in all points without non-capitalist
surroundings, we cannot gain a true picture of it by assuming
the exclusive and absolute domination of the capitalist mode of
production. Sismondi and his school, when they attributed their
difficulties entirely to the problem of realising the surplus value,
indeed revealed a proper sense for the conditions vital to
accumulation. Yet the conditions for augmenting the material
elements of constant and variable capital are quite a different
matter from those which govern the realisation of surplus value.
Capital needs the means of production and the labour power
of the whole globe for untrammelled accumulation; it cannot
manage without the natural resources and the labour power of
all territories. Seeing that the overwhelming majority of resources
and labour power is in fact still in the orbit of pre-capitalist
production&mdash;this being the historical <i>milieu</i> of accumulation&mdash;capital
must go all out to obtain ascendancy over these
territories and social organisations. There is no <i>a priori</i> reason
why rubber plantations, say, run on capitalist lines, such as
have been laid out in India, might not serve the ends of capitalist
production just as well. Yet if the countries of those
branches of production are predominantly non-capitalist, capital
will endeavour to establish domination over these countries and
societies. And in fact, primitive conditions allow of a greater
drive and of far more ruthless measures than could be tolerated
under purely capitalist social conditions.</p>

<p>It is quite different with the realisation of the surplus value.
Here outside consumers <i>qua</i> other-than-capitalist are really
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
essential. Thus the immediate and vital conditions for capital
and its accumulation is the existence of non-capitalist buyers of
the surplus value, which is decisive to this extent for the problem
of capitalist accumulation.</p>

<p>Whatever the theoretical aspects, the accumulation of capital,
as an historical process, depends in every respect upon non-capitalist
social strata and forms of social organisation.</p>

<p>The solution to this problem which for almost a century has
been the bone of contention in economic theory thus lies between
the two extremes of the petty-bourgeois scepticism
preached by Sismondi, v. Kirchmann, Vorontsov and Nicolayon,
who flatly denied accumulation, and the crude
optimism advocated by Ricardo, Say and Tugan Baranovski
who believed in capital&#8217;s unlimited capacity for parthenogenesis,
with the logical corollary of capitalism-in-perpetuity.
The solution envisaged by Marx lies in the dialectical conflict
that capitalism needs non-capitalist social organisations as the
setting for its development, that it proceeds by assimilating the
very conditions which alone can ensure its own existence.</p>

<p>At this point we should revise the conceptions of internal and
external markets which were so important in the controversy
about accumulation. They are both vital to capitalist development
and yet fundamentally different, though they must be
conceived in terms of social economy rather than of political
geography. In this light, the internal market is the capitalist
market, production itself buying its own products and supplying
its own elements of production. The external market is the
non-capitalist social environment which absorbs the products of
capitalism and supplies producer goods and labour power for
capitalist production. Thus, from the point of view of economics,
Germany and England traffic in commodities chiefly on an
internal, capitalist market, whilst the give and take between
German industry and German peasants is transacted on an
external market as far as German capital is concerned. These
concepts are strict and precise, as can be seen from the diagram
of reproduction. Internal capitalist trade can at best realise only
certain quantities of value contained in the social product: the
constant capital that has been used up, the variable capital, and
the consumed part of the surplus value. That part of the surplus
value, however, which is earmarked for capitalisation, must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
realised elsewhere. If capitalisation of surplus value is the real
motive force and aim of production, it must yet proceed within
the limits given by the renewal of constant and variable capital
(and also of the consumed part of the surplus value). Further,
with the international development of capitalism the capitalisation
of surplus value becomes ever more urgent and precarious,
and the substratum of constant and variable capital becomes
an ever-growing mass&mdash;both absolutely and in relation to the
surplus value. Hence the contradictory phenomena that the old
capitalist countries provide ever larger markets for, and become
increasingly dependent upon, one another, yet on the other
hand compete ever more ruthlessly for trade relations with non-capitalist
countries.<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>  The conditions for the capitalisation of
surplus value clash increasingly with the conditions for the
renewal of the aggregate capital&mdash;a conflict which, incidentally,
is merely a counterpart of the contradictions implied in the law
of a declining profit rate.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXVII</i></h2>

<h2>THE STRUGGLE AGAINST NATURAL
ECONOMY</h2>

<p>Capitalism arises and develops historically amidst a non-capitalist
society. In Western Europe it is found at first
in a feudal environment from which it in fact sprang&mdash;the
system of bondage in rural areas and the guild system in the
towns&mdash;and later, after having swallowed up the feudal system,
it exists mainly in an environment of peasants and artisans, that
is to say in a system of simple commodity production both
in agriculture and trade. European capitalism is further surrounded
by vast territories of non-European civilisation ranging
over all levels of development, from the primitive communist
hordes of nomad herdsmen, hunters and gatherers to commodity
production by peasants and artisans. This is the setting
for the accumulation of capital.</p>

<p>We must distinguish three phases: the struggle of capital
against natural economy, the struggle against commodity economy,
and the competitive struggle of capital on the international
stage for the remaining conditions of accumulation.</p>

<p>The existence and development of capitalism requires an
environment of non-capitalist forms of production, but not
every one of these forms will serve its ends. Capitalism needs
non-capitalist social strata as a market for its surplus value, as a
source of supply for its means of production and as a reservoir
of labour power for its wage system. For all these purposes,
forms of production based upon a natural economy are of no
use to capital. In all social organisations where natural economy
prevails, where there are primitive peasant communities with
common ownership of the land, a feudal system of bondage or
anything of this nature, economic organisation is essentially in
response to the internal demand; and therefore there is no
demand, or very little, for foreign goods, and also, as a rule, no
surplus production, or at least no urgent need to dispose of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
surplus products. What is most important, however, is that, in
any natural economy, production only goes on because both
means of production and labour power are bound in one form
or another. The communist peasant community no less than the
feudal <i>corvée</i> farm and similar institutions maintain their economic
organisation by subjecting the labour power, and the
most important means of production, the land, to the rule of
law and custom. A natural economy thus confronts the requirements
of capitalism at every turn with rigid barriers. Capitalism
must therefore always and everywhere fight a battle of annihilation
against every historical form of natural economy that it
encounters, whether this is slave economy, feudalism, primitive
communism, or patriarchal peasant economy. The principal
methods in this struggle are political force (revolution, war),
oppressive taxation by the state, and cheap goods; they are
partly applied simultaneously, and partly they succeed and
complement one another. In Europe, force assumed revolutionary
forms in the fight against feudalism (this is the ultimate
explanation of the bourgeois revolutions in the seventeenth,
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries); in the non-European
countries, where it fights more primitive social organisations, it
assumes the forms of colonial policy. These methods, together
with the systems of taxation applied in such cases, and commercial
relations also, particularly with primitive communities,
form an alliance in which political power and economic factors
go hand in hand.</p>

<p>In detail, capital in its struggle against societies with a natural
economy pursues the following ends:</p>

<p>(1) To gain immediate possession of important sources of productive
forces such as land, game in primeval forests, minerals,
precious stones and ores, products of exotic flora such as rubber,
etc.</p>

<p>(2) To &#8216;liberate&#8217; labour power and to coerce it into service.</p>

<p>(3) To introduce a commodity economy.</p>

<p>(4) To separate trade and agriculture.</p>

<p>At the time of primitive accumulation, i.e. at the end of the
Middle Ages, when the history of capitalism in Europe began,
and right into the nineteenth century, dispossessing the peasants
in England and on the Continent was the most striking weapon
in the large-scale transformation of means of production and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
labour power into capital. Yet capital in power performs the
same task even to-day, and on an even more important scale&mdash;by
modern colonial policy. It is an illusion to hope that capitalism
will ever be content with the means of production which
it can acquire by way of commodity exchange. In this respect
already, capital is faced with difficulties because vast tracts of
the globe&#8217;s surface are in the possession of social organisations
that have no desire for commodity exchange or cannot, because
of the entire social structure and the forms of ownership, offer
for sale the productive forces in which capital is primarily interested.
The most important of these productive forces is of
course the land, its hidden mineral treasure, and its meadows,
woods and water, and further the flocks of the primitive shepherd
tribes. If capital were here to rely on the process of slow
internal disintegration, it might take centuries. To wait patiently
until the most important means of production could be alienated
by trading in consequence of this process were tantamount
to renouncing the productive forces of those territories altogether.
Hence derives the vital necessity for capitalism in its
relations with colonial countries to appropriate the most important
means of production. Since the primitive associations of the
natives are the strongest protection for their social organisations
and for their material bases of existence, capital must begin by
planning for the systematic destruction and annihilation of all
the non-capitalist social units which obstruct its development.
With that we have passed beyond the stage of primitive accumulation;
this process is still going on. Each new colonial expansion
is accompanied, as a matter of course, by a relentless battle of
capital against the social and economic ties of the natives, who
are also forcibly robbed of their means of production and labour
power. Any hope to restrict the accumulation of capital exclusively
to &#8216;peaceful competition&#8217;, i.e. to regular commodity
exchange such as takes place between capitalist producer-countries,
rests on the pious belief that capital can accumulate without
mediation of the productive forces and without the demand
of more primitive organisations, and that it can rely upon the
slow internal process of a disintegrating natural economy.
Accumulation, with its spasmodic expansion, can no more wait
for, and be content with, a natural internal disintegration of
non-capitalist formations and their transition to commodity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
economy, than it can wait for, and be content with, the natural
increase of the working population. Force is the only solution
open to capital; the accumulation of capital, seen as an historical
process, employs force as a permanent weapon, not only
at its genesis, but further on down to the present day. From the
point of view of the primitive societies involved, it is a matter of
life or death; for them there can be no other attitude than
opposition and fight to the finish&mdash;complete exhaustion and extinction.
Hence permanent occupation of the colonies by the
military, native risings and punitive expeditions are the order of
the day for any colonial regime. The method of violence, then,
is the immediate consequence of the clash between capitalism
and the organisations of a natural economy which would restrict
accumulation. Their means of production and their labour
power no less than their demand for surplus products is necessary
to capitalism. Yet the latter is fully determined to undermine
their independence as social units, in order to gain possession
of their means of production and labour power and to
convert them into commodity buyers. This method is the most
profitable and gets the quickest results, and so it is also the most
expedient for capital. In fact, it is invariably accompanied by
a growing militarism whose importance for accumulation will
be demonstrated below in another connection. British policy in
India and French policy in Algeria are the classical examples of
the application of these methods by capitalism.</p>

<p>The ancient economic organisations of the Indians&mdash;the communist
village community&mdash;had been preserved in their various
forms throughout thousands of years, in spite of all the political
disturbances during their long history. In the sixth century
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> the Persians invaded the Indus basin and subjected part of
the country. Two centuries later the Greeks entered and left
behind them colonies, founded by Alexander on the pattern
of a completely alien civilisation. Then the savage Scythians
invaded the country, and for centuries India remained under
Arab rule. Later, the Afghans swooped down from the Iran
mountains, until they, too, were expelled by the ruthless onslaught
of Tartar hordes. The Mongols&#8217; path was marked by
terror and destruction, by the massacre of entire villages&mdash;the
peaceful countryside with the tender shoots of rice made crimson
with blood. And still the Indian village community survived.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
For none of the successive Mahometan conquerors had
ultimately violated the internal social life of the peasant masses
and its traditional structure. They only set up their own governors
in the provinces to supervise military organisation and to
collect taxes from the population. All conquerors pursued the
aim of dominating and exploiting the country, but none was interested
in robbing the people of their productive forces and in
destroying their social organisation. In the Moghul Empire, the
peasant had to pay his annual tribute in kind to the foreign
ruler, but he could live undisturbed in his village and could
cultivate his rice on his <i>sholgura</i> as his father had done before
him. Then came the British&mdash;and the blight of capitalist civilisation
succeeded in disrupting the entire social organisation of the
people; it achieved in a short time what thousands of years,
what the sword of the Nogaians, had failed to accomplish. The
ultimate purpose of British capital was to possess itself of the
very basis of existence of the Indian community: the land.</p>

<p>This end was served above all by the fiction, always popular
with European colonisers, that all the land of a colony belongs
to the political ruler. In retrospect, the British endowed the
Moghul and his governors with private ownership of the whole
of India, in order to &#8216;legalise&#8217; their succession. Economic experts
of the highest repute, such as James Mill, duly supported this
fiction with &#8216;scientific&#8217; arguments, so in particular with the
famous conclusion given below.<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
As early as 1793, the British in Bengal gave landed property
to all the <i>zemindars</i> (Mahometan tax collectors) or hereditary
market superintendents they had found in their district so as to
win native support for the campaign against the peasant masses.
Later they adopted the same policy for their new conquests in
the Agram province, in Oudh, and in the Central Provinces.
Turbulent peasant risings followed in their wake, in the course
of which tax collectors were frequently driven out. In the resulting
confusion and anarchy British capitalists successfully appropriated
a considerable portion of the land.</p>

<p>The burden of taxation, moreover, was so ruthlessly increased
that it swallowed up nearly all the fruits of the people&#8217;s
labour. This went to such an extreme in the Delhi and Allahabad
districts that, according to the official evidence of the
British tax authorities in 1854, the peasants found it convenient
to lease or pledge their shares in land for the bare amount of
the tax levied. Under the auspices of this taxation, usury came
to the Indian village, to stay and eat up the social organisation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
from within like a canker.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>  In order to accelerate this process,
the British passed a law that flew in the face of every tradition
and justice known to the village community: compulsory alienation
of village land for tax arrears. In vain did the old family
associations try to protect themselves by options on their hereditary
land and that of their kindred. There was no stopping the
rot. Every day another plot of land fell under the hammer;
individual members withdrew from the family unit, and the
peasants got into debt and lost their land.</p>

<p>The British, with their wonted colonial stratagems, tried to
make it appear as if their power policy, which had in fact
undermined the traditional forms of landownership and brought
about the collapse of the Hindu peasant economy, had been
dictated by the need to protect the peasants against native
oppression and exploitation and served to safeguard their own
interests.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>  Britain artificially created a landed aristocracy at the
expense of the ancient property-rights of the peasant communities,
and then proceeded to &#8216;protect&#8217; the peasants against these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
alleged oppressors, and to bring this illegally usurped land into
the possession of British capitalists.</p>

<p>Thus large estates developed in India in a short time, while
over large areas the peasants in their masses were turned into
impoverished small tenants with a short-term lease.</p>

<p>Lastly, one more striking fact shows the typically capitalist
method of colonisation. The British were the first conquerors of
India who showed gross indifference to public utilities. Arabs,
Afghans and Mongols had organised and maintained magnificent
works of canalisation in India, they had given the country
a network of roads, spanned the rivers with bridges and seen to
the sinking of wells. Timur or Tamerlane, the founder of the
Mongol dynasty in India, had a care for the cultivation of the
soil, for irrigation, for the safety of the roads and the provision
of food for travellers.<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>  The primitive Indian Rajahs, the Afghan
or Mongol conquerors, at any rate, in spite of occasional cruelty
against individuals, made their mark with the marvellous constructions
we can find to-day at every step and which seem to
be the work of a giant race. &#8216;The (East India) Company which
ruled India until 1858 did not make one spring accessible, did
not sink a single well, nor build a bridge for the benefit of the
Indians.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
Another witness, the Englishman James Wilson, says: &#8216;In the
Madras Province, no-one can help being impressed by the magnificent
ancient irrigation systems, traces of which have been
preserved until our time. Locks and weirs dam the rivers into
great lakes, from which canals distribute the water for an area
of 60 or 70 miles around. On the large rivers, there are 30 to
40 of such weirs.... The rain water from the mountains was
collected in artificial ponds, many of which still remain and
boast circumferences of between 15 and 25 miles. Nearly all
these gigantic constructions were completed before the year
1750. During the war between the Company and the Mongol
rulers&mdash;and, be it said, <i>during the entire period of our rule in India</i>&mdash;they
have sadly decayed.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>No wonder! British capital had no object in giving the Indian
communities economic support or helping them to survive.
Quite the reverse, it aimed to destroy them and to deprive them
of their productive forces. The unbridled greed, the acquisitive
instinct of accumulation must by its very nature take every
advantage of the &#8216;conditions of the market&#8217; and can have no
thought for the morrow. It is incapable of seeing far enough
to recognise the value of the economic monuments of an older
civilisation. (Recently British engineers in Egypt feverishly tried
to discover traces of an ancient irrigation system rather like the
one a stupid lack of vision had allowed to decay in India, when
they were charged with damming the Nile on a grand scale in
furtherance of capitalist enterprise.) Not until 1867 was England
able to appreciate the results of her noble efforts in this
respect. In the terrible famine of that year a million people were
killed in the Orissa district alone; and Parliament was shocked
into investigating the causes of the emergency. The British
government has now introduced administrative measures in an
attempt to save the peasant from usury. The Punjab Alienation
Act of 1900 made it illegal to sell or mortgage peasant lands
to persons other than of the peasant caste, though exceptions
can be made in individual cases, subject to the tax collector&#8217;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
approval.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>  Having deliberately disrupted the protecting ties of
the ancient Hindu social associations, after having nurtured a
system of usury where nothing is thought of a 15 per cent charge
of interest, the British now entrust the ruined Indian peasant
to the tender care of the Exchequer and its officials, under the
&#8216;protection&#8217;, that is to say, of those draining him of his livelihood.</p>

<p>Next to tormented British India, Algeria under French rule
claims pride of place in the annals of capitalist colonisation.
When the French conquered Algeria, ancient social and economic
institutions prevailed among the Arab-Kabyle population.
These had been preserved until the nineteenth century,
and in spite of the long and turbulent history of the country
they survive in part even to the present day.</p>

<p>Private property may have existed no doubt in the towns,
among the Moors and Jews, among merchants, artisans and
usurers. Large rural areas may have been seized by the State
under Turkish suzerainty&mdash;yet nearly half of the productive
land is jointly held by Arab and Kabyle tribes who still keep up
the ancient patriarchal customs. Many Arab families led the
same kind of nomad life in the nineteenth century as they had
done since time immemorial, an existence that appears restless
and irregular only to the superficial observer, but one that is in
fact strictly regulated and extremely monotonous. In summer
they were wont, man, woman and child, to take their herds and
tents and migrate to the sea-swept shores of the Tell district;
and in the winter they would move back again to the protective
warmth of the desert. They travelled along definite routes, and
the summer and winter stations were fixed for every tribe and
family. The fields of those Arabs who had settled on the land
were in most cases the joint property of the clans, and the great
Kabyle family associations also lived according to old traditional
rules under the patriarchal guidance of their elected
heads.</p>

<p>The women would take turns for household duties; a matriarch,
again elected by the family, being in complete charge of the
clan&#8217;s domestic affairs, or else the women taking turns of duty.
This organisation of the Kabyle clans on the fringe of the
African desert bears a startling resemblance to that of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
famous Southern Slavonic <i>Zadruga</i>&mdash;not only the fields but all
the tools, weapons and monies, all that the members acquire or
need for their work, are communal property of the clan. Personal
property is confined to one suit of clothing, and in the case
of a woman to the dresses and ornaments of her dowry. More
valuable attire and jewels, however, are considered common
property, and individuals were allowed to use them only if the
whole family approved. If the clan was not too numerous, meals
were taken at a common table; the women took it in turns to
cook, but the eldest were entrusted with the dishing out. If a
family circle was too large, the head of the family would each
month ration out strictly proportionate quantities of uncooked
food to the individual families who then prepared them. These
communities were bound together by close ties of kinship,
mutual assistance and equality, and a patriarch would implore
his sons on his deathbed to remain faithful to the family.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>These social relations were already seriously impaired by the
rule of the Turks, established in Algeria in the sixteenth century.
Yet the Turkish exchequer had by no means confiscated
all the land. That is a legend invented by the French at a much
later date. Indeed, only a European mind is capable of such a
flight of fancy which is contrary to the entire economic foundation
of Islam both in theory and practice. In truth, the facts
were quite different. The Turks did not touch the communal
fields of the village communities. They merely confiscated a
great part of uncultivated land from the clans and converted it
into crownland under Turkish local administrators (<i>Beyliks</i>).
The state worked these lands in part with native labour, and
in part they were leased out on rent or against payment in
kind. Further the Turks took advantage of every revolt of the
subjected families and of every disturbance in the country to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
add to their possessions by large-scale confiscation of land, either
for military establishments or for public auction, when most of
it went to Turkish or other usurers. To escape from the burden
of taxation and confiscation, many peasants placed themselves
under the protection of the Church, just as they had done in
medieval Germany. Hence considerable areas became Church-property.
All these changes finally resulted in the following distribution
of Algerian land at the time of the French conquest:
crownlands occupied nearly 3,750,000 acres, and a further
7,500,000 acres of uncultivated land as common property of
All the Faithful (<i>Bled-el-Islam</i>). 7,500,000 acres had been
privately owned by the Berbers since Roman times, and under
Turkish rule a further 3,750,000 acres had come into private
ownership, a mere 12,500,000 acres remaining communal property
of individual Arab clans. In the Sahara, some of the
7,500,000 acres fertile land near the Sahara Oases was communally
owned by the clans and some belonged to private
owners. The remaining 57,000,000 acres were mainly waste
land.</p>

<p>With their conquest of Algeria, the French made a great ado
about their work of civilisation, since the country, having
shaken off the Turkish yoke at the beginning of the eighteenth
century, was harbouring the pirates who infested the Mediterranean
and trafficked in Christian slaves. Spain and the
North American Union in particular, themselves at that time
slave traders on no mean scale, declared relentless war on this
Moslem iniquity. France, in the very throes of the Great Revolution,
proclaimed a crusade against Algerian anarchy. Her
subjection of that country was carried through under the slogans
of &#8216;combating slavery&#8217; and &#8216;instituting orderly and civilised conditions&#8217;.
Yet practice was soon to show what was at the bottom
of it all. It is common knowledge that in the forty years following
the subjection of Algeria, no European state suffered so
many changes in its political system as France: the restoration
of the monarchy was followed by the July Revolution and the
reign of the &#8216;Citizen King&#8217;, and this was succeeded by the
February Revolution, the Second Republic, the Second Empire,
and finally, after the disaster of 1870, by the Third Republic.
In turn, the aristocracy, high finance, petty bourgeoisie and the
large middle classes in general gained political ascendancy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
Yet French policy in Algeria remained undeflected by this succession
of events; it pursued a single aim from beginning to end;
at the fringe of the African desert, it demonstrated plainly that
all the political revolutions in nineteenth-century France centred
in a single basic interest: the rule of a capitalist bourgeoisie
and its institutions of ownership.</p>

<p>&#8216;The bill submitted for your consideration&#8217;, said Deputy
Humbert on June 30, 1873, in the Session of the French
National Assembly as spokesman for the Commission for Regulating
Agrarian Conditions in Algeria, &#8216;is but the crowning
touch to an edifice well-founded on a whole series of ordinances,
edicts, laws and decrees of the Senate which together and
severally have as the same object: the establishment of private
property among the Arabs.&#8217;</p>

<p>In spite of the ups and downs of internal French politics
French colonial policy persevered for fifty years in its systematic
and deliberate efforts to destroy and disrupt communal property.
It served two distinct purposes: The break-up of communal
property was primarily intended to smash the social
power of the Arab family associations and to quell their stubborn
resistance against the French yoke, in the course of which
there were innumerable risings so that, in spite of France&#8217;s
military superiority, the country was in a continual state of
war.<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>  Secondly, communal property had to be disrupted in
order to gain the economic assets of the conquered country; the
Arabs, that is to say, had to be deprived of the land they had
owned for a thousand years, so that French capitalists could get
it. Once again the fiction we know so well, that under Moslem
law all land belongs to the ruler, was brought into play. Just
as the English had done in British India, so Louis Philippe&#8217;s
governors in Algeria declared the existence of communal property
owned by the clan to be &#8216;impossible&#8217;. This fiction served
as an excuse to claim for the state most of the uncultivated areas,
and especially the commons, woods and meadows, and to use
them for purposes of colonisation. A complete system of settlement
developed, the so-called <i>cantonments</i> which settled French
colonists on the clan land and herded the tribes into a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
area. Under the decrees of 1830, 1831, 1840, 1844, 1845 and
1846 these thefts of Arab family land were legalised. Yet this
system of settlement did not actually further colonisation; it
only bred wild speculation and usury. In most instances the
Arabs managed to buy back the land that had been taken from
them, although they were thus incurring heavy debts. French
methods of oppressive taxation had the same tendency, in particular
the law of June 16, 1851, proclaiming all forests to be state
property, which robbed the natives of 6,000,000 acres of pasture
and brushwood, and took away the prime essential for
animal husbandry. This spate of laws, ordinances and regulations
wrought havoc with the ownership of land in the country.
Under the prevailing condition of feverish speculation in land,
many natives sold their estates to the French in the hope of ultimately
recovering them. Quite often they sold the same plot to
two or three buyers at a time, and what is more, it was quite
often inalienable family land and did not even belong to them.
A company of speculators from Rouen, e.g., believed that they
had bought 50,000 acres, but in fact they had only acquired a
disputed title to 3,425 acres. There followed an infinite number
of lawsuits in which the French courts supported on principle
all partitions and claims of the buyers. In these uncertain conditions,
speculation, usury and anarchy were rife. But although
the introduction of French colonists in large numbers among
the Arab population had aimed at securing support for the
French government, this scheme failed miserably. Thus, under
the Second Empire, French policy tried another tack. The
government, with its European lack of vision, had stubbornly
denied the existence of communal property for thirty years, but
it had learned better at last. By a single stroke of the pen, joint
family property was officially recognised and condemned to be
broken up. This is the double significance of the decree of the
Senate dated April 22, 1864. General Allard declared in the
Senate:</p>

<p>&#8216;The government does not lose sight of the fact that the
general aim of its policy is to weaken the influence of the tribal
chieftains and to dissolve the family associations. By this means,
it will sweep away the last remnants of feudalism [<i>sic!</i>] defended
by the opponents of the government bill.... The surest method
of accelerating the process of dissolving the family associations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
will be to institute private property and to settle European
colonists among the Arab families.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>The law of 1863 created special Commissions for cutting
up the landed estates, consisting of the Chairman, either a
Brigadier-General or Colonel, one <i>sous-préfet</i>, one representative
of the Arab military authorities and an official bailiff. These
natural experts on African economics and social conditions were
faced with the threefold task, first of determining the precise
boundaries of the great family estates, secondly to distribute the
estates of each clan among its various branches, and finally to
break up this family land into separate private allotments. This
expedition of the Brigadiers into the interior of Africa duly took
place. The Commissions proceeded to their destinations. They
were to combine the office of judge in all land disputes with
that of surveyor and land distributor, the final decision resting
with the Governor-General of Algeria. Ten years&#8217; valiant
efforts by the Commissions yielded the following result: between
1863 and 1873, of 700 hereditary estates, 400 were shared out
among the branches of each clan, and the foundations for future
inequalities between great landed estates and small allotments
were thus laid. One family, in fact, might receive between 2·5
and 10 acres, while another might get as much as 250 or even
450 acres, depending on the size of the estate and the number
of collaterals within the clan. Partition, however, stopped at
that point. Arab customs presented unsurmountable difficulties
to a further division of family land. In spite of Colonels and
Brigadiers, French policy had again failed in its object to create
private property for transfer to the French.</p>

<p>But the Third Republic, an undisguised regime of the bourgeoisie,
had the courage and the cynicism to go straight for its
goal and to attack the problem from the other end, disdaining
the preliminaries of the Second Empire. In 1873, the National
Assembly worked out a law with the avowed intention immediately
to split up the entire estates of all the 700 Arab clans,
and forcibly to institute private property in the shortest possible
time. Desperate conditions in the colony were the pretext for
this measure. It had taken the great Indian famine of 1866 to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
awaken the British public to the marvellous exploits of British
colonial policy and to call for a parliamentary investigation;
and similarly, Europe was alarmed at the end of the sixties by
the crying needs of Algeria where more than forty years of
French rule culminated in wide-spread famine and a disastrous
mortality rate among the Arabs. A commission of inquiry was
set up to recommend new legislation with which to bless the
Arabs: it was unanimously resolved that there was only one life-buoy
for them&mdash;the institution of private property; that alone
could save the Arab from destitution, since he would then
always be able to sell or mortgage his land. It was decided therefore,
that the only means of alleviating the distress of the Arabs,
deeply involved in debts as they were because of the French
land robberies and oppressive taxation, was to deliver them
completely into the hands of the usurers. This farce was expounded
in all seriousness before the National Assembly and
was accepted with equal gravity by that worthy body. The
&#8216;victors&#8217; of the Paris Commune flaunted their brazenness.</p>

<p>In the National Assembly, two arguments in particular served
to support the new law: those in favour of the bill emphasised
over and over again that the Arabs themselves urgently desired
the introduction of private property. And so they did, or rather
the Algerian land speculators and usurers did, since they were
vitally interested in &#8216;liberating&#8217; their victims from the protection
of the family ties. As long as Moslem law prevailed in Algeria,
hereditary clan and family lands were inalienable, which laid
insuperable difficulties in the way of anyone who wished to
mortgage his land. The law of 1863 had merely made a breach
in these obstacles, and the issue now at stake was their complete
abolition so as to give a free hand to the usurers. The second
argument was &#8216;scientific&#8217;, part of the same intellectual equipment
from which that worthy, James Mill, had drawn for his
abstruse conclusions regarding Indian relations of ownership:
English classical economics. Thoroughly versed in their masters&#8217;
teachings, the disciples of Smith and Ricardo impressively
declaimed that private property is indispensable for the prevention
of famines in Algeria, for more intensive and better cultivation
of the land, since obviously no one would be prepared to
invest capital or intensive labour in a piece of land which does
not belong to him and whose produce is not his own to enjoy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
But the facts spoke a different language. They proved that the
French speculators employed the private property they had
created in Algeria for anything but the more intensive and
improved cultivation of the soil. In 1873, 1,000,000 acres were
French property. But the capitalist companies, the Algerian and
Setif Company which owned 300,000 acres, did not cultivate
the land at all but leased it to the natives who tilled it in the
traditional manner, nor were 25 per cent of the other French
owners engaged in agriculture. It was simply impossible to conjure
up capitalist investments and intensive agriculture overnight,
just as capitalist conditions in general could not be
created out of nothing. They existed only in the imagination of
profit-seeking French speculators, and in the benighted doctrinaire
visions of their scientific economists. The essential point,
shorn of all pretexts and flourishes which seem to justify the law
of 1873, was simply the desire to deprive the Arabs of their
land, their livelihood. And although these arguments had worn
threadbare and were evidently insincere, this law which was to
put paid to the Algerian population and their material prosperity,
was passed unanimously on July 26, 1873.</p>

<p>But even this master-stroke soon proved a failure. The policy
of the Third Republic miscarried because of the difficulties in
substituting at one stroke bourgeois private property for the
ancient clan communism, just as the policy of the Second Empire
had come to grief over the same issue. In 1890, when the law
of July 26, 1873, supplemented by a second law on April 28,
1887, had been in force for seventeen years, 14,000,000 francs
had been spent on dealing with 40,000,000 acres. It was estimated
that the process would not be completed before 1950 and
would require a further 60,000,000 francs. And still abolition of
clan communism, the ultimate purpose, had not been accomplished.
What had really been attained was all too evident:
reckless speculation in land, thriving usury and the economic
ruin of the natives.</p>

<p>Since it had been impossible to institute private property by
force, a new experiment was undertaken. The laws of 1873 and
1887 had been condemned by a commission appointed for their
revision by the Algerian government in 1890. It was another
seven years before the legislators on the Seine made the effort
to consider reforms for the ruined country. The new decree of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
the Senate refrained in principle from instituting private property
by compulsion or administrative measures. The laws of
February 2, 1897, and the edict of the Governor-General of
Algeria (March 3, 1898) both provided chiefly for the introduction
of private property following a voluntary application by
the prospective purchaser or owner.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>  But there were clauses to
permit a single owner, without the consent of the others, to
claim private property; further, such a &#8216;voluntary&#8217; application
can be extorted at any convenient moment if the owner is in
debt and the usurer exerts pressure. And so the new law left the
doors wide open for French and native capitalists further to
disrupt and exploit the hereditary and clan lands.</p>

<p>Of recent years, this mutilation of Algeria which had been
going on for eight decades meets with even less opposition,
since the Arabs, surrounded as they are by French capital following
the subjection of Tunisia (1881) and the recent conquest
of Morocco, have been rendered more and more helpless. The
latest result of the French regime in Algeria is an Arab exodus
into Turkey.<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXVIII</i></h2>

<h2>THE INTRODUCTION OF COMMODITY
ECONOMY</h2>

<p>The second condition of importance for acquiring means
of production and realising the surplus value is that commodity
exchange and commodity economy should be
introduced in societies based on natural economy as soon as
their independence has been abrogated, or rather in the course
of this disruptive process. Capital requires to buy the products
of, and sell its commodities to, all non-capitalist strata and
societies. Here at last we seem to find the beginnings of that
&#8216;peace&#8217; and &#8216;equality&#8217;, the <i>do ut des</i>, mutual interest, &#8216;peaceful
competition&#8217; and the &#8216;influences of civilisation&#8217;. For capital can
indeed deprive alien social associations of their means of production
by force, it can compel the workers to submit to capitalist
exploitation, but it cannot force them to buy its commodities or
to realise its surplus value. In districts where natural economy
formerly prevailed, the introduction of means of transport&mdash;railways,
navigation, canals&mdash;is vital for the spreading of commodity
economy, a further hopeful sign. The triumphant march of
commodity economy thus begins in most cases with magnificent
constructions of modern transport, such as railway lines which
cross primeval forests and tunnel through the mountains, telegraph
wires which bridge the deserts, and ocean liners which call
at the most outlying ports. But it is a mere illusion that these
are peaceful changes. Under the standard of commerce, the
relations between the East India Company and the spice-producing
countries were quite as piratical, extortionate and blatantly
fraudulent as present-day relations between American
capitalists and the Red Indians of Canada whose furs they buy,
or between German merchants and the Negroes of Africa.
Modern China presents a classical example of the &#8216;gentle&#8217;,
&#8216;peace-loving&#8217; practices of commodity exchange with backward
countries. Throughout the nineteenth century, beginning with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
the early forties, her history has been punctuated by wars with
the object of opening her up to trade by brute force. Missionaries
provoked persecutions of Christians, Europeans instigated
risings, and in periodical massacres a completely helpless and
peaceful agrarian population was forced to match arms with the
most modern capitalist military technique of all the Great
Powers of Europe. Heavy war contributions necessitated a
public debt, China taking up European loans, resulting in
European control over her finances and occupation of her fortifications;
the opening of free ports was enforced, railway concessions
to European capitalists extorted. By all these measures
commodity exchange was fostered in China, from the early
thirties of the last century until the beginning of the Chinese
revolution.</p>

<p>European civilisation, that is to say commodity exchange
with European capital, made its first impact on China with the
Opium Wars when she was compelled to buy the drug from
Indian plantations in order to make money for British capitalists.
In the seventeenth century, the East India Company had
introduced the cultivation of poppies in Bengal; the use of the
drug was disseminated in China by its Canton branch. At the
beginning of the nineteenth century, opium fell so considerably
in price that it rapidly became the &#8216;luxury of the people&#8217;. In
1821, 4,628 chests of opium were imported to China at an
average price of £265; then the price fell by 50 per cent, and
Chinese imports rose to 9,621 chests in 1825, and to 26,670
chests in 1830.<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>  The deadly effects of the drug, especially of the
cheaper kinds used by the poorer population, became a public
calamity and made it necessary for China to lay an embargo
on imports, as an emergency measure. Already in 1828, the
viceroy of Canton had prohibited imports of opium, only to
deflect the trade to other ports. One of the Peking censors commanded
to investigate the question gave the following report:</p>

<p>&#8216;I have learnt that people who smoke opium have developed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
such a craving for this noxious drug that they make every effort
to obtain this gratification. If they do not get their opium at
the usual hour, their limbs begin to tremble, they break out in
sweat, and they cannot perform the slightest tasks. But as soon
as they are given the pipe, they inhale a few puffs and are cured
immediately.</p>

<p>&#8216;Opium has therefore become a necessity for all who smoke it,
and it is not surprising that under cross-examination by the
local authorities they will submit to every punishment rather
than reveal the names of their suppliers. Local authorities are
also in some cases given presents to tolerate the evil or to delay
any investigation already under way. Most merchants who
bring goods for sale into Canton also deal in smuggled opium.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am of the opinion that opium is by far a greater evil than
gambling, and that opium smokers should therefore be punished
no less than gamblers.&#8217;</p>

<p>The censor suggested that every convicted opium smoker
should be sentenced to eighty strokes of the bamboo, and anybody
refusing to give the name of his supplier to a hundred
strokes and three years of exile. The pigtailed Cato of Peking
concludes his report with a frankness staggering to any European
official: &#8216;Apparently opium is mostly introduced from
abroad by dishonest officials in connivance with profit-seeking
merchants who transport it into the interior of the country.
Then the first to indulge are people of good family, wealthy
private persons and merchants, but ultimately the drug habit
spreads among the common people. I have learnt that in all
provinces opium is smoked not only in the civil service but also
in the army. The officials of the various districts indeed enjoin
the legal prohibition of sale by special edicts. But at the same
time, their parents, families, dependants and servants simply go
on smoking opium, and the merchants profit from the ban by
increased prices. Even the police have been won over; they buy
the stuff instead of helping to suppress it, and this is an additional
reason for the disregard in which all prohibitions and
ordinances are held.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>Consequently, a stricter law was passed in 1833 which made
every opium smoker liable to a hundred strokes and two months
in the stocks, and provincial governors were ordered to report
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
annually on their progress in the battle against opium. But there
were two sequels to this campaign: on the one hand large-scale
poppy plantations sprang up in the interior, particularly in the
Honan, Setchuan, and Kueitchan provinces, and on the other,
England declared war on China to get her to lift the embargo.
These were the splendid beginnings of &#8216;opening China&#8217; to
European civilisation&mdash;by the opium pipe.</p>

<p>Canton was the first objective. The fortifications of the town
at the main arm of the Perl estuary could not have been more
primitive. Every day at sunset a barrier of iron chains was
attached to wooden rafts anchored at various distances, and
this was the main defence. Moreover, the Chinese guns could
only fire at a certain angle and were therefore completely ineffectual.
With such primitive defences, just adequate to prevent
a few merchant ships from landing, did the Chinese meet
the British attack. A couple of British cruisers, then, sufficed to
effect an entry on September 7, 1839. The sixteen battle-junks
and thirteen fire-ships which the Chinese put up for resistance
were shot up or dispersed in a matter of forty-five minutes. After
this initial victory, the British renewed the attack in the beginning
of 1841 with a considerably reinforced fleet. This time the
fleet, consisting in a number of battle-junks, and the forts were
attacked simultaneously. The first incendiary rocket that was
fired penetrated through the armour casing of a junk into the
powder chamber and blew the ship with the entire crew sky-high.
In a short time eleven junks, including the flag-ship, were
destroyed, and the remainder precipitately made for safety.
The action on land took a little longer. Since the Chinese guns
were quite useless, the British walked right through the fortifications,
climbed to a strategic position&mdash;which was not even
guarded&mdash;and proceeded to slaughter the helpless Chinese from
above. The casualty list of the battle was: for the Chinese
600 dead, and for the British, 1 dead and 30 wounded, more
than half of the latter having been injured by the accidental
explosion of a powder magazine. A few weeks later, there
followed another British exploit. The forts of Anung-Hoy and
North Wantong were to be taken. No less than twelve fully
equipped cruisers were available for this task. What is more,
the Chinese, once again forgetful of the most important thing,
had omitted to fortify the island of South Wantong. Thus the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
British calmly landed a battery of howitzers to bombard the
fort from one side, the cruisers shelling it from the other. After
that, the Chinese were driven from the forts in a matter of
minutes, and the landing met with no resistance. The ensuing
display of inhumanity&mdash;an English report says&mdash;will be for ever
deeply deplored by the British staff. The Chinese, trying to
escape from the barricades, had fallen into a moat which was
soon literally filled to the brim with helpless soldiers begging for
mercy. Into this mass of prostrate human bodies, the sepoys&mdash;acting
against orders, it is claimed&mdash;fired again and again. This
is the way in which Canton was made receptive to commodity
exchange.</p>

<p>Nor did the other ports fare better. On July 4, 1841, three
British cruisers with 120 cannon appeared off the islands in the
entrance to the town of Ningpo. More cruisers arrived the following
day. In the evening the British admiral sent a message
to the Chinese governor, demanding the capitulation of the
island. The governor explained that he had no power to resist
but could not surrender without orders from Peking. He therefore
asked for a delay. This was refused, and at half-past two in
the morning the British stormed the defenceless island. Within
eight minutes, the fort and the houses on the shore were reduced
to smouldering rubble. Having landed on the deserted coast
littered with broken spears, sabres, shields, rifles and a few dead
bodies, the troops advanced on the walls of the island town of
Tinghai. With daybreak, reinforced by the crews of other ships
which had meanwhile arrived, they proceeded to put scaling-ladders
to the scarcely defended ramparts. A few more minutes
gave them mastery of the town. This splendid victory was
announced with becoming modesty in an Order of the Day: &#8216;Fate
has decreed that the morning of July 5, 1841, should be the historic
date on which Her Majesty&#8217;s flag was first raised over the
most beautiful island of the Celestial Empire, the first European
flag to fly triumphantly above this lovely countryside.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>On August 25, 1841, the British approached the town of
Amoy, whose forts were armed with a hundred of the heaviest
Chinese guns. These guns being almost useless, and the commanders
lacking in resource, the capture of the harbour was
child&#8217;s play. Under cover of a heavy barrage, British ships drew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
near the walls of Kulangau, landed their marines, and after a
short stand the Chinese troops were driven out. The twenty-six
battle-junks with 128 guns in the harbour were also captured,
their crews having fled. One battery, manned by Tartars, heroically
held out against the combined fire of three British ships, but
a British landing was effected in their rear and the post wiped
out.</p>

<p>This was the finale of the notorious Opium War. By the peace
treaty of August 27, 1842, the island of Hongkong was ceded to
Britain. In addition, the towns of Canton, Amoy, Futchou,
Ningpo and Shanghai were to open their ports to foreign commerce.
But within fifteen years, there was a further war against
China. This time, Britain had joined forces with the French.
In 1857, the allied navies captured Canton with a heroism equal
to that of the first war. By the peace of Tientsin (1858), the
opium traffic, European commerce and Christian missions were
admitted into the interior. Already in 1859, however, the
British resumed hostilities and attempted to destroy the Chinese
fortifications on the Peiho river, but were driven off after a fierce
battle in which 464 people were wounded or killed.<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
After that, Britain and France again joined forces. At the end
of August 1860, 12,600 English and 7,500 French troops under
General Cousin-Montauban first captured the Taku forts without
a single shot having been fired. Then they proceeded towards
Tientsin and on towards Peking. A bloody battle was
joined at Palikao, and Peking fell to the European Powers.
Entering the almost depopulated and completely undefended
city, the victors began by pillaging the Imperial Palace, manfully
helped by General Cousin himself, who was later to become
field marshal and Count of Palikao. Then the Palace went up
in flames, fired on Lord Elgin&#8217;s order as an imposed penance.<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p>The European Powers now obtained concessions to set up
embassies in Peking, and to start trading with Tientsin and
other towns. The Tchi-fu Convention of 1876 guaranteed full
facilities for importing opium into China&mdash;at a time when the
Anti-Opium League in England agitated against the spreading
of the drug habit in London, Manchester and other industrial
districts, when a parliamentary commission declared the consumption
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
of opium to be harmful in the extreme. By all treaties
made at that time between China and the Great Powers any
European, whether merchant or missionary, was guaranteed the
right to acquire land, to which end the legitimate arguments
were ably supported by deliberate fraud.</p>

<p>First and foremost the ambiguity of the treaty texts made a
convenient excuse for European capital to encroach beyond
the Treaty Ports. It used every loophole in the wording of the
treaties to begin with, and subsequently blackmailed the Chinese
government into permitting the missions to acquire land not
alone in the Treaty Ports but in all the provinces of the realm.
Their claim was based upon the notorious bare-faced distortion
of the Chinese original in Abbé Delamarre&#8217;s official translation
of the supplementary convention with France. French diplomacy,
and the Protestant missions in particular, unanimously
condemned the crafty swindle of the Catholic padre, but nevertheless
they were firm that the rights of French missions obtained
by this fraud should be explicitly extended to the Protestant
missions as well.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p>China&#8217;s entry into commodity exchange, having begun with
the Opium Wars, was finally accomplished with a series of
&#8216;leases&#8217; and the China campaign of 1900, when the commercial
interests of European capital sank to a brazen international
dogfight over Chinese land. The description of the Dowager
Empress, who wrote to Queen Victoria after the capture of the
Taku forts, subtly underlines this contrast between the initial
theory and the ultimate practice of the &#8216;agents of European
civilisation&#8217;:</p>

<p>&#8216;To your Majesty, greeting!&mdash;In all the dealings of England
with the Empire of China, since first relations were established
between us, there has never been any idea of territorial aggrandisement
on the part of Great Britain, but only a keen desire to
promote the interests of her trade. Reflecting upon the fact that
our country is now plunged into a dreadful condition of warfare,
we bear in mind that a large proportion of China&#8217;s trade,
seventy or eighty per cent, is done with England; moreover,
your Customs duties are the lightest in the world, and few restrictions
are made at your sea-ports in the matter of foreign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
importations; for these reasons our amiable relations with
British merchants at our Treaty Ports have continued unbroken
for the last half century, to our mutual benefit.&mdash;But a sudden
change has now occurred and general suspicion has been
created against us. We would therefore ask you now to consider
that if, by any conceivable combination of circumstances,
the independence of our Empire should be lost, and the Powers
unite to carry out their long-plotted schemes to possess themselves
of our territory&#8217;&mdash;(in a simultaneous message to the
Emperor of Japan, the impulsive Tzu Hsi openly refers to &#8216;The
earth-hungry Powers of the West, whose tigerish eyes of greed
are fixed in our direction&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> )&mdash;&#8216;the results to your country&#8217;s
interests would be disastrous and fatal to your trade. At this
moment our Empire is striving to the utmost to raise an army
and funds sufficient for its protection; in the meanwhile we rely
on your good services to act as mediator, and now anxiously
await your decision.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>Both during the wars and in the interim periods, European
civilisation was busy looting and thieving on a grand scale in
the Chinese Imperial Palaces, in the public buildings and in
the monuments of ancient civilisation, not only in 1860, when
the French pillaged the Emperor&#8217;s Palace with its legendary
treasures, or in 1900, &#8216;when all the nations vied with each other
to steal public and private property&#8217;. Every European advance
was marked not only with the progress of commodity exchange,
but by the smouldering ruins of the largest and most venerable
towns, by the decay of agriculture over large rural areas, and
by intolerably oppressive taxation for war contributions. There
are more than 40 Chinese Treaty Ports&mdash;and every one of them
has been paid for with streams of blood, with massacre and
ruin.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXIX</i></h2>

<h2>THE STRUGGLE AGAINST PEASANT
ECONOMY</h2>

<p>An important final phase in the campaign against natural
economy is to separate industry from agriculture,
to eradicate rural industries altogether from peasant
economy. Handicraft in its historical beginnings was a subsidiary
occupation, a mere appendage to agriculture in civilised
and settled societies. In medieval Europe it became gradually
independent of the <i>corvée</i> farm and agriculture, it developed
into specialised occupations, i.e. production of commodities by
urban guilds. In industrial districts, production had progressed
from home craft by way of primitive manufacture to the capitalist
factory of the staple industries, but in the rural areas, under
peasant economy, home crafts persisted as an intrinsic part of
agriculture. Every hour that could be spared from cultivating
the soil was devoted to handicrafts which, as an auxiliary
domestic industry, played an important part in providing for
personal needs.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>It is a recurrent phenomenon in the development of capitalist
production that one branch of industry after the other is singled
out, isolated from agriculture and concentrated in factories for
mass production. The textile industry provides the textbook
example, but the same thing has happened, though less
obviously, in the case of other rural industries. Capital must get
the peasants to buy its commodities and will therefore begin by
restricting peasant economy to a single sphere&mdash;that of agriculture&mdash;which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
will not immediately and, under European conditions
of ownership, only with great difficulty submit to capitalist
domination.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>  To all outward appearance, this process is
quite peaceful. It is scarcely noticeable and seemingly caused
by purely economic factors. There can be no doubt that mass
production in the factories is technically superior to primitive
peasant industry, owing to a higher degree of specialisation,
scientific analysis and management of the productive process,
improved machinery and access to international resources of
raw materials. In reality, however, the process of separating
agriculture and industry is determined by factors such as
oppressive taxation, war, or squandering and monopolisation of
the nation&#8217;s land, and thus belongs to the spheres of political
power and criminal law no less than with economics.</p>

<p>Nowhere has this process been brought to such perfection as
in the United States. In the wake of the railways, financed by
European and in particular British capital, the American farmer
crossed the Union from East to West and in his progress over
vast areas killed off the Red Indians with fire-arms and blood-hounds,
liquor and venereal disease, pushing the survivors to
the West, in order to appropriate the land they had &#8216;vacated&#8217;,
to clear it and bring it under the plough. The American farmer,
the &#8216;backwoodsman&#8217; of the good old times before the War of
Secession, was very different indeed from his modern counterpart.
There was hardly anything he could not do, and he led
a practically self-sufficient life on his isolated farm.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the nineties, one of the leaders of the
Farmers&#8217; Alliance, Senator Peffer, wrote as follows: &#8216;The American
farmer of to-day is altogether a different sort of man from
his ancestor of fifty or a hundred years ago. A great many men
and women now living remember when farmers were largely
manufacturers; that is to say, they made a great many implements
for their own use. Every farmer had an assortment of
tools with which he made wooden implements, as forks and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
rakes, handles for his hoes and ploughs, spokes for his wagon,
and various other implements made wholly out of wood. Then
the farmer produced flax and hemp and wool and cotton. These
fibres were prepared upon the farm; they were spun into yarn,
woven into cloth, made into garments, and worn at home.
Every farm had upon it a little shop for wood and iron work,
and in the dwelling were cards and looms; carpets were woven,
bed-clothing of different sorts was prepared; upon every farm
geese were kept, their feathers used for supplying the home
demand with beds and pillows, the surplus being disposed of at
the nearest market town. During the winter season wheat and
flour and corn meal were carried in large wagons drawn by
teams of six to eight horses a hundred or two hundred miles to
market, and traded for farm supplies for the next year&mdash;groceries
and dry goods. Besides this, mechanics were scattered
among the farmers. The farm wagon was in process of building
a year or two; the material was found near the shop; the character
of the timber to be used was stated in the contract; it had
to be procured in a certain season and kept in the drying process
a length of time specified, so that when the material was brought
together in proper form and the wagon made, both parties to
the contract knew where every stick of it came from, and how
long it had been in seasoning. During winter time the neighbourhood
carpenter prepared sashes and blinds and doors and
moulding and cornices for the next season&#8217;s building. When the
frosts of autumn came the shoemaker repaired to the dwellings
of the farmers and there, in a corner set apart to him, he made
up shoes for the family during the winter. All these things were
done among the farmers, and a large part of the expense was
paid with products of the farm. When winter approached, the
butchering season was at hand; meat for family use during the
next year was prepared and preserved in the smoke house. The
orchards supplied fruit for cider, for apple butter, and for preserves
of different kinds, amply sufficient to supply the wants of
the family during the year, with some to spare. Wheat was
threshed, a little at a time, just enough to supply the needs of the
family for ready money, and not enough to make it necessary
to waste one stalk of straw. Everything was saved and put to use.
One of the results of that sort of economy was that comparatively
a very small amount of money was required to conduct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
the business of farming. A hundred dollars average probably
was as much as the largest farmers of that day needed in the
way of cash to meet the demands of their farm work, paying for
hired help, repairs of tools, and all other incidental expenses.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>This Arcadian life was to come to a sudden end after the
War of Secession. The war had burdened the Union with an
enormous National Debt, amounting to £1,200,000, and in
consequence the taxes were considerably increased. On the
other hand, a feverish development of modern traffic and industry,
machine-building in particular, was encouraged by the
imposition of higher protective tariffs. The railway companies
were endowed with public lands on an imposing scale, in order
to promote railroad construction and farm-settlements: in 1867
alone, they were given more than 192,500,000 acres, and so the
permanent way grew at an unprecedented rate. In 1860 it
amounted to less than 31,000 miles, in 1870 it had grown to
more than 53,000 miles and in 1880 to more than 93,000 miles.
(During the same period&mdash;1870-1880&mdash;the permanent way in
Europe had grown from 80,000 miles to 100,000 miles.) The railways
and speculations in land made for mass emigration from
Europe to the United States, and more than <span class="fraction" title="4 and 1 half">4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></span> million people
immigrated in the twenty-three years from 1869 to 1892. In this
way, the Union gradually became emancipated from European,
and in particular from British, industry; factories were set up
in the States and home industries developed for the production
of textiles, iron, steel and machinery. The process of revolutionary
transformation was most rapid in agriculture. The
emancipation of the slaves had compelled the Southern planters
to introduce the steam plough shortly after the Civil War, and
new farms had sprung up in the West in the wake of the railways,
which from the very beginning employed the most
modern machinery and technique.</p>

<p>&#8216;The improvements are rapidly revolutionising the agriculture
of the West, and reducing to the lowest minimum ever
attained, the proportion of manual labour employed in its
operations.... Coincident with this application of mechanics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
to agriculture, systematic and enlarged business aptitudes have
also sought alliance with this noble art. Farms of thousands of
acres have been managed with greater skill, a more economical
adaptation of means to ends, and with a larger margin of real
profit than many others of 80 acres.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>During this time, direct and indirect taxation had increased
enormously. On June 30, 1864, during the Civil War, a new
finance bill was passed which is the basis of the present system
of taxation, and which raised taxes on consumption and income
to a staggering degree. This heavy war levy served as a pretext
for a real orgy of protective tariffs in order to offset the tax on
home production by customs duties.<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>  Messrs. Morrill, Stevens
and the other gentlemen who advanced the war as a lever for
enforcing their protectionist programme, initiated the practice
of wielding the implement of a customs policy quite openly and
cynically to further private profiteering interests of all descriptions.
Any home producer who appeared before the legislative
assembly with a request for any kind of special tariff to fill his
own pocket saw his demands readily granted, and the tariff
rates were made as high as any interested party might wish.</p>

<p>&#8216;The war&#8217;, writes the American Taussig, &#8216;had in many ways a
bracing and ennobling influence on our national life; but its
immediate effect on business affairs, and on all legislation
affecting moneyed interests, was demoralising. The line between
public duty and private interests was often lost sight of by
legislators. Great fortunes were made by changes in legislation
urged and brought about by those who were benefited by
them, and the country has seen with sorrow that the honour and
honesty of public men did not remain undefiled.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
This customs bill which completely revolutionised the country&#8217;s
economic life, and remained in force unchanged for twenty
years, was literally pushed through Congress in three days, and
through the Senate in two, without criticism, without debate,
without any opposition whatever.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>  Down to the present day it
forms the basis of U.S. customs legislation.</p>

<p>This shift in U.S. fiscal policy ushered in an era of the most
brazen parliamentary log-rolling and of undisguised and unrestrained
corruption of elections, of the legislature and the
press to satisfy the greed of Big Business. &#8216;<i>Enrichissez-vous</i>&#8217; became
the catchword of public life after the &#8216;noble war&#8217; to liberate
mankind from the &#8216;blot of slavery&#8217;. On the stock exchange, the
Yankee negro-liberator sought his fortunes in orgies of speculation;
in Congress, he endowed himself with public lands,
enriched himself by customs and taxes, by monopolies, fraudulent
shares and theft of public funds. Industry prospered. Gone
were the times when the small or medium farmer required
hardly any money, when he could thresh and turn into cash his
wheat reserves as the need arose. Now he was chronically in need
of money, a lot of money, to pay his taxes. Soon he was forced to
sell all his produce and to buy his requirements from the manufacturers
in the form of ready-made goods. As Peffer puts it:</p>

<p>&#8216;Coming from that time to the present, we find that everything
nearly has been changed. All over the West particularly
the farmer threshes his wheat all at one time, he disposes of
it all at one time, and in a great many instances the straw is
wasted. He sells his hogs, and buys bacon and pork; he sells
his cattle, and buys fresh beef and canned beef or corned beef,
as the case may be; he sells his fruit, and buys it back in cans.
If he raises flax at all, instead of putting it into yarn and making
gowns for his children, as he did fifty years or more ago, he
threshes his flax, sells the seed, and burns the straw. Not more
than one farmer in fifty now keeps sheep at all; he relies upon
the large sheep farmer for the wool, which is put into cloth or
clothing ready for his use. Instead of having clothing made up
on the farm in his own house or by a neighbour woman or
country tailor a mile away, he either purchases his clothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
ready made at the nearest town, or he buys the cloth and has a
city tailor make it up for him. Instead of making implements
which he uses about the farm&mdash;forks, rakes, etc.&mdash;he goes to
town to purchase even a handle for his axe or his mallet; he
purchases twine and rope and all sorts of needed material made
of fibres; he buys his cloth and his clothing; he buys his canned
fruit and preserved fruit; he buys hams and shoulders and mess
pork and mess beef; indeed, he buys nearly everything now that
he produced at one time himself, and these things all cost
money. Besides all this, and what seems stranger than anything
else, whereas in the earlier time the American home was a free
home, unencumbered, not one case in a thousand where a
home was mortgaged to secure the payment of borrowed money,
and whereas but a small amount of money was then needed for
actual use in conducting the business of farming, there was
always enough of it among the farmers to supply the demand.
Now, when at least ten times as much is needed, there is little or
none to be obtained, nearly half the farms are mortgaged for as
much as they are worth, and interest rates are exorbitant. As to
the cause of such wonderful changes ... the manufacturer came
with his woollen mill, his carding mill, his broom factory, his
rope factory, his wooden-ware factory, his cotton factory, his
pork-packing establishment, his canning factory and fruit preserving
houses; the little shop on the farm has given place to the
large shop in town; the wagon-maker&#8217;s shop in the neighbourhood
has given way to the large establishment in the city where
... a hundred or two hundred wagons are made in a week;
the shoemaker&#8217;s shop has given way to large establishments in
the cities where most of the work is done by machines.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>Finally, the agricultural labour of the farmer himself has
become machine work: &#8216;He ploughs and sows and reaps with
machines. A machine cuts his wheat and puts it in a sheaf, and
steam drives his threshers. He may read the morning paper
while he ploughs and sit under an awning while he reaps.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>Sering estimated in the middle eighties that the necessary
cash &#8216;for a very modest beginning&#8217; of the smallest farm in the
North West is £240 to £280.<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
This revolution of American agriculture after the &#8216;Great War&#8217;
was not the end. It was only the beginning of the whirlpool in
which the farmer was caught. His history brings us automatically
to the second phase of the development of capitalist
accumulation of which it is an excellent illustration.&mdash;Natural
economy, the production for personal needs and the close
connection between industry and agriculture must be ousted
and a simple commodity economy substituted for them. Capitalism
needs the medium of commodity production for its
development, as a market for its surplus value. But as soon as
simple commodity production has superseded natural economy,
capital must turn against it. No sooner has capital called it
to life, than the two must compete for means of production,
labour power, and markets. The first aim of capitalism is to
isolate the producer, to sever the community ties which protect
him, and the next task is to take the means of production away
from the small manufacturer.</p>

<p>In the American Union, as we have seen, the &#8216;Great War&#8217;
inaugurated an era of large-scale seizure of public lands by
monopolist capitalist companies and individual speculators.
Feverish railroad building and ever more speculation in railway
shares led to a mad gamble in land, where individual soldiers
of fortune and companies netted immense fortunes and even
entire counties. In addition a veritable swarm of agents lured
the vast flow of emigrants from Europe to the U.S.A. by blatant
and unscrupulous advertising, deceptions and pretences of
every description. These immigrants first settled in the Eastern
States along the Atlantic seaboard, and, with the growth of
industry in these states, agriculture was driven westward. The
&#8216;wheat centre&#8217; which had been near Columbus, Ohio, in 1850,
in the course of the subsequent fifty years shifted to a position
99 miles further North and 680 miles further West. Whereas in
1850 51·4 per cent of the total wheat crop had been supplied
by the Eastern States, in 1880 they produced only 13·6 per cent,
71·7 per cent being supplied by the Northern Central and 9 per
cent by the Western States.</p>

<p>In 1825, the Congress of the Union under Monroe had
decided to transplant the Red Indians from the East to the West
of the Mississippi. The redskins put up a desperate resistance;
but all who survived the slaughter of forty Red Indian campaigns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
were swept away like so much rubbish and driven like
cattle to the West to be folded in reservations like so many sheep.
The Red Indian had been forced to make room for the farmer&mdash;and
now the farmer in his turn was driven beyond the
Mississippi to make way for capital.</p>

<p>Following the railway tracks, the American farmer moved
West and North-West into the land of promise which the great
land speculators&#8217; agents had painted for him in glowing colours.
Yet the most fertile and most favourably situated lands were
retained by the companies who farmed them extensively on
completely capitalistic lines. All around the farmer who had
been exiled into the wilderness, a dangerous competitor and
deadly enemy sprang up&mdash;the &#8216;bonanza farms&#8217;, the great capitalist
agricultural concerns which neither the Old World nor the
New had known before. Here surplus value was produced with
the application of all the resources known to modern science
and technology.</p>

<p>&#8216;As the foremost representative of financial agriculture we
may consider Oliver Dalrymple, whose name is to-day known
on both sides of the Atlantic. Since 1874 he has simultaneously
managed a line of steamers on the Red River and six farms
owned by a company of financiers and comprising some 75,000
acres. Each one is divided into departments of 2,000 acres,
and every department is again subdivided into three sections
of 667 acres which are run by foremen and gangleaders.
Barracks to shelter 50 men and stable as many horses and mules,
are built on each section, and similarly kitchens, machine sheds
and workshops for blacksmiths and locksmiths. Each section is
completely equipped with 20 pairs of horses, 8 double ploughs,
12 horse-drawn drill-ploughs, 12 steel-toothed harrows, 12
cutters and binders, 2 threshers and 16 wagons. Everything is
done to ensure that the machines and the living labour (men,
horses and mules) are in good condition and able to do the
greatest possible amount of work. There is a telephone line
connecting all sections and the central management.</p>

<p>&#8216;The six farms of 75,000 acres are cultivated by an army of
600 workers, organised on military lines. During the harvest, the
management hires another 500 to 600 auxiliary workers, assigning
them to the various sections. After the work is completed in
the fall, the workers are dismissed with the exception of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
foreman and 10 men per section. In some farms in Dakota and
Minnesota, horses and mules do not spend the winter at the
place of work. As soon as the stubble has been ploughed in, they
are driven in teams of a hundred or two hundred pairs 900
miles to the South, to return only the following spring.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mechanics on horseback follow the ploughing, sowing and
harvesting machines when they are at work. If anything goes
wrong, they gallop to the machine in question, repair it and get
it moving again without delay. The harvested corn is carried
to the threshing machines which work day and night without
interruption. They are stoked with bundles of straw fed into the
stokehold through pipes of sheet-iron. The corn is threshed,
winnowed, weighed and filled into sacks by machinery, then it
is put into railway trucks which run alongside the farm, and goes
to Duluth or Buffalo. Every year, Dalrymple increases his land
under seed by 5,800 acres. In 1880 it amounted to 25,000 acres.<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<p>In the late seventies, there were already individual capitalists
and companies who owned 35,000-45,000 acres of wheat land.
Since the time of Lafargue&#8217;s writing, extensive capitalist agriculture
in America has made great strides in technique and the
employment of machinery.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
The American farmer could not successfully compete with
such capitalist enterprises. At a time when the general revolution
in the conditions of finance, production and transport compelled
him to give up production for personal needs and to
produce exclusively for the market, the great spreading of
agriculture caused a heavy fall in the prices of agricultural
products. And at the precise moment when farming became
dependent on the market, the agricultural market of the Union
was suddenly turned from a local one into a world market, and
became a prey to the wild speculations of a few capitalist
mammoth concerns.</p>

<p>In 1879, a notable year for the history of agricultural conditions
in Europe as well as in America, there began the mass
export of wheat from the U.S.A. to Europe.<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>Big Business was of course the only one to profit from this
expanding market. The small farmer was crushed by the competition
of an increasing number of extensive farms and became
the prey of speculators who bought up his corn to exert pressure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
on the world market. Helpless in the face of the immense capitalist
powers, the farmer got into debt&mdash;a phenomenon typical
for a declining peasant economy. In 1890, Secretary Rusk of
the U.S. Department of Agriculture sent out a circular letter
with reference to the desperate position of the farmers, saying:</p>

<p>&#8216;The burden of mortgages upon farms, homes, and land, is
unquestionably discouraging in the extreme, and while in some
cases no doubt this load may have been too readily assumed,
still in the majority of cases the mortgage has been the result
of necessity.... These mortgages ... drawing high rates of
interest ... have to-day, in the face of continued depression of
the prices of staple products, become very irksome, and in many
cases threaten the farmer with loss of home and land. It is a
question of grave difficulty to all those who seek to remedy the
ills from which our farmers are suffering. At present prices the
farmer finds that it takes more of his products to get a dollar
wherewith to buy back the dollar which he borrowed than it
did when he borrowed it. The interest accumulates, while the
payment of the principal seems utterly hopeless, and the very
depression which we are discussing makes the renewal of the
mortgage most difficult.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p>According to the census of May 29, 1891, 2·5 million farms
were deep in debt; two-thirds of them were managed by the
owners whose obligations amounted to nearly £440,000.</p>

<p>&#8216;The situation is this: farmers are passing through the &#8220;valley
and shadow of death&#8221;; farming as a business is profitless; values
of farm products have fallen 50 per cent since the great war, and
farm values have depreciated 25 to 50 per cent during the last
ten years; farmers are overwhelmed with debts secured by mortgages
on their homes, unable in many instances to pay even the
interest as it falls due, and unable to renew the loans because
securities are weakening by reason of the general depression;
many farmers are losing their homes under this dreadful blight,
and the mortgage mill still grinds. We are in the hands of a
merciless power; the people&#8217;s homes are at stake.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>Encumbered with debts and close to ruin, the farmer had no
option but to supplement his earnings by working for a wage, or
else to abandon his farm altogether. Provided it had not yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
fallen into the clutches of his creditors like so many thousands of
farms, he could shake from off his feet the dust of the &#8216;land of
promise&#8217; that had become an inferno for him. In the middle
eighties, abandoned and decaying farms could be seen everywhere.
In 1887, Sering wrote:</p>

<p>&#8216;If the farmer cannot pay his debts to date, the interest he has
to pay is increased to 12, 15 or even 20 per cent. He is pressed
by the banker, the machine salesman and the grocer who rob
him of the fruits of his hard work.... He can either remain on
the farm as a tenant or move further West, to try his fortunes
elsewhere. Nowhere in North America have I found so many
indebted, disappointed and depressed farmers as in the wheat
regions of the North Western prairies. I have not spoken to a
single farmer in Dakota who would not have been prepared to
sell his farm.<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>&#8216;The Commissioner of Agriculture of Vermont in 1889 reported
a wide-spread desertion of farm-lands of that state. He
wrote: &#8220;... there appears to be no doubt about there being in
this state large tracts of tillable unoccupied lands, which can be
bought at a price approximating the price of Western lands,
situated near school and church, and not far from railroad
facilities. The Commissioner has not visited all of the counties
in the State where these lands are reported, but he has visited
enough to satisfy him that, while much of the unoccupied and
formerly cultivated land is now practically worthless for cultivation,
yet very much of it can be made to yield a liberal reward
to intelligent labour.&#8221;&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>The Commissioner of the State of New Hampshire issued a
pamphlet in 1890, devoting 67 pages to the description of farms
for sale at the lowest figures. He describes 1442 farms with
tenantable buildings, abandoned only recently. The same has
happened in other districts. Thousands of acres once raising
corn and wheat are left untilled and run to brush and wood.</p>

<p>In order to resettle the deserted land, speculators engaged in
advertising campaigns and attracted crowds of new immigrants&mdash;new
victims who were to suffer their predecessors&#8217; fate even
more speedily.</p>

<p>A private letter says: &#8216;In the neighbourhood of railroads and
markets, there remains no common land. It is all in the hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
of the speculators. A settler takes over vacant land and counts
for a farmer; but the management of his farm hardly assures
his livelihood, and he cannot possibly compete with the big
farmer. He tills as much of his land as the law compels him to
do, but to make a comfortable living, he must look for additional
sources of income outside agriculture. In Oregon, for instance,
I have met a settler who owned 160 acres for five years, but
every summer, until the end of July, he worked twelve hours a
day for a dollar a day at road-making. This man, of course, also
counts as one of the five million farmers in the 1890 census.
Again, in the County of Eldorado, I saw many farmers who
cultivated their land only to feed their cattle and themselves.
There would have been no profit in producing for the market,
and their chief income derives from gold-digging, the felling and
selling of timber, etc. These people are prosperous, but it is not
agriculture which makes them so. Two years ago, we worked
in Long Cañon, Eldorado County, living in a cabin on an allotment.
The owner of this allotment came home only once a year
for a couple of days, and worked the rest of the time on the
railway in Sacramento. Some years ago, a small part of the
allotment was cultivated, to comply with the law, but now it is
left completely untilled. A few acres are fenced off with wire,
and there is a log cabin and a shed. But during the last years
all this stands empty; a neighbour has the key and he made us
free of the hut. In the course of our journey, we saw many
deserted allotments, where attempts at farming had been made.
Three years ago I was offered a farm with dwelling house for
a hundred dollars, but in a short time the unoccupied house
collapsed under the snow. In Oregon, we saw many derelict
farms with small dwelling houses and vegetable gardens. One
we visited was beautifully made: a sturdy block house, fashioned
by a master-builder, and some equipment; but the farmer
had abandoned it all. You were welcome to take it all without
charge.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p>Where could the ruined American farmer turn? He set out
on a pilgrimage to follow the wheat centre and the railways.
The former had shifted in the main to Canada, the Saskatchewan
and the Mackenzie River where wheat can still thrive
on the 62nd parallel. A number of American farmers followed&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
after some time in Canada, they suffered the old fate.<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>
During recent years, Canada has entered the world market as
a wheat-exporting country, but her agriculture is dominated to
an even greater extent by big capital than elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>In Canada, public lands were lavished upon private capitalist
companies on an even more monstrous scale than in the
United States. Under the Charter of the Canadian Pacific Railway
Company with its grant of land, private capital perpetrated
an unprecedented act of robbing the public. Not only that the
company was guaranteed a twenty years&#8217; monopoly of railway-building,
not only that it got a building site of about 713 miles
free of charge, not only that it got a 100 years&#8217; state guarantee
of the 3 per cent interest on the share capital of £m. 20&mdash;to
crown it all, the company was given the choice of 25 million
acres out of the most fertile and favourably situated lands, not
necessarily in the immediate vicinity of the permanent way, as
a free gift. All future settlers on this vast area were thus at the
mercy of railway capital from the very outset. The railway
company, in its turn, immediately proceeded to sell off 5 million
acres for ready cash to the North-West Land Company, an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
association of British capitalists under the chairmanship of the
Duke of Manchester. The second group of capitalists which was
liberally endowed with public lands was the Hudson Bay Company,
which was given a title to no less than one-twentieth of
all the lands between Lake Winnipeg, the U.S. border, the
Rocky Mountains, and Northern Saskatchewan, for renouncing
their privileges in the North-West. Between them, these two
capitalist groups had gained possession of five-ninths of all the
land that could be settled. A considerable part of the other lands
was assigned by the State to 26 capitalist &#8216;colonising companies&#8217;.<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>
Thus the Canadian farmer was practically everywhere ensnared
by capital and capitalist speculation. And still mass immigration
continued&mdash;not only from Europe, but also from the United
States!</p>

<p>These are the characteristics of capitalist domination on an
international scale. Having evicted the peasant from his soil, it
drives him from England to the East of the United States, and
from there to the West, and on the ruins of the Red Indians&#8217;
economy it transforms him back into a small commodity producer.
Then, when he is ruined once more, he is driven from the
West to the North. With the railways in the van, and ruin in the
rear&mdash;capital leads the way, its passage is marked with universal
destruction. The great fall of prices in the nineties is again
succeeded by higher prices for agricultural products, but this
is of no more avail to the small American farmer than to the
European peasant.</p>

<p>Yet the numbers of farmers are constantly swelling. In the
last decade of the nineteenth century they had grown from
4,600,000 to 5,700,000, and the following ten years still saw an
absolute increase. The aggregate value of farms had during the
same period risen from £150,240,000 to £330,360,000.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>  We
might have expected the general increase in the price of farm
produce to have helped the farmer to come into his own. But
that is not so; we see that the growing numbers of tenant farmers
outstrip the increase in the farming population as a whole. In
1880, the proportion of tenant farmers amounted to 25·5 per
cent of the total number of farmers in the Union, in 1890 it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
28·4 per cent, in 1900 35·3 per cent, and in 1910 37·2 per
cent.</p>

<p>Though prices for farm produce were rising, the tenant farmer
was more and more rapidly stepping into the shoes of the independent
farmer. And although much more than one-third of
all farmers in the Union are now tenant farmers, their social
status in the United States is that of the agricultural labourer in
Europe. Constantly fluctuating, they are indeed wage-slaves of
capital; they work very hard to create wealth for capital, getting
nothing in return but a miserable and precarious existence.</p>

<p>In quite a different historical setting, in South Africa, the
same process shows up even more clearly the &#8216;peaceful methods&#8217;
by which capital competes with the small commodity producer.</p>

<p>In the Cape Colony and the Boer Republics, pure peasant
economy prevailed until the sixties of the last century. For a
long time the Boers had led the life of animal-tending nomads;
they had killed off or driven out the Hottentots and Kaffirs with
a will in order to deprive them of their most valuable pastures.
In the eighteenth century they were given invaluable assistance
by the plague, imported by ships of the East India Company,
which frequently did away with entire Hottentot tribes whose
lands then fell to the Dutch immigrants. When the Boers spread
further East, they came in conflict with the Bantu tribes and
initiated the long period of the terrible Kaffir wars. These god-fearing
Dutchmen regarded themselves as the Chosen People
and took no small pride in their old-fashioned Puritan morals
and their intimate knowledge of the Old Testament; yet, not
content with robbing the natives of their land, they built their
peasant economy like parasites on the backs of the Negroes,
compelling them to do slave-labour for them and corrupting
and enervating them deliberately and systematically. Liquor
played such an important part in this process, that the prohibition
of spirits in the Cape Colony could not be carried
through by the English government because of Puritan opposition.
There were no railways until 1859, and Boer economy in
general and on the whole remained patriarchal and based on
natural economy until the sixties. But their patriarchal attitude
did not deter the Boers from extreme brutality and harshness.
It is well known that Livingstone complained much more about
the Boers than about the Kaffirs. The Boers considered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
Negroes an object, destined by God and Nature to slave
for them, and as such an indispensable foundation of their
peasant economy. So much so that their answer to the abolition
of slavery in the English colonies in 1836 was the &#8216;Great
Trek&#8217;, although there the owners had been compensated with
£3,000,000. By way of the Orange River and Vaal, the Boers
emigrated from the Cape Colony, and in the process they drove
the Matabele to the North, across the Limpopo, setting them
against the Makalakas. Just as the American farmer had driven
the Red Indian West before him under the impact of capitalist
economy, so the Boer drove the Negro to the North. The &#8216;Free
Republics&#8217; between the Orange River and the Limpopo thus
were created as a protest against the designs of the English
bourgeoisie on the sacred right of slavery. The tiny peasant
republics were in constant guerilla warfare against the Bantu
Negroes. And it was on the backs of the Negroes that the battle
between the Boers and the English government, which went on
for decades, was fought. The Negro question, i.e. the emancipation
of the Negroes, ostensibly aimed at by the English bourgeoisie,
served as a pretext for the conflict between England and
the republics. In fact, peasant economy and great capitalist
colonial policy were here competing for the Hottentots and
Kaffirs, that is to say for their land and their labour power.
Both competitors had precisely the same aim: to subject, expel
or destroy the coloured peoples, to appropriate their land and
press them into service by the abolition of their social organisations.
Only their methods of exploitation were fundamentally
different. While the Boers stood for out-dated slavery on a petty
scale, on which their patriarchal peasant economy was founded,
the British bourgeoisie represented modern large-scale capitalist
exploitation of the land and the natives. The Constitution of the
Transvaal (South African) Republic declared with crude prejudice:
&#8216;The People shall not permit any equality of coloured
persons with white inhabitants, neither in the Church nor in the
State.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>In the Orange Free State and in the Transvaal no Negro was
allowed to own land, to travel without papers or to walk abroad
after sunset. Bryce tells us of a case where a farmer, an Englishman
as it happened, in the Eastern Cape Colony had flogged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
his Kaffir slave to death. When he was acquitted in open court,
his neighbours escorted him home to the strains of music. The
white man frequently maltreated his free native labourers after
they had done their work&mdash;to such an extent that they would
take to flight, thus saving the master their wages.</p>

<p>The British government employed precisely the opposite
tactics. For a long time it appeared as protector of the natives;
flattering the chieftains in particular, it supported their authority
and tried to make them claim a right of disposal over their
land. Wherever it was possible, it gave them ownership of tribal
land, according to well-tried methods, although this flew in the
face of tradition and of the actual social organisation of the
Negroes. All tribes in fact held their land communally, and even
the most cruel and despotic rulers such as the Matabele Chieftain
Lobengula merely had the right as well as the duty to allot
every family a piece of land which they could only retain so
long as they cultivated it. The ultimate purpose of the British
government was clear: long in advance it was preparing for
land robbery on a grand scale, using the native chieftains themselves
as tools. But in the beginning it was content with the
&#8216;pacification&#8217; of the Negroes by extensive military actions. Up
to 1879 were fought 9 bloody Kaffir wars to break the resistance
of the Bantus.</p>

<p>British capital revealed its real intentions only after two important
events had taken place: the discovery of the Kimberley
diamond fields in 1869-70, and the discovery of the gold mines
in the Transvaal in 1882-5, which initiated a new epoch in the
history of South Africa. Then the British South Africa Company,
that is to say Cecil Rhodes, went into action. Public opinion in
England rapidly swung over, and the greed for the treasures
of South Africa urged the British government on to drastic
measures. South Africa was suddenly flooded with immigrants
who had hitherto only appeared in small numbers&mdash;immigration
having been deflected to the United States. But with the
discovery of the diamond and gold fields, the numbers of white
people in the South African colonies grew by leaps and bounds:
between 1885 and 1895, 100,000 British had immigrated into
Witwatersrand alone. The modest peasant economy was forthwith
pushed into the background&mdash;the mines, and thus the
mining capital, coming to the fore. The policy of the British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
government veered round abruptly. Great Britain had recognised
the Boer Republics by the Sand River Agreement and the
Treaty of Bloemfontein in the fifties. Now her political might
advanced upon the tiny republics from every side, occupying
all neighbouring districts and cutting off all possibility of expansion.
At the same time the Negroes, no longer protected
favourites, were sacrificed. British capital was steadily forging
ahead. In 1868, Britain took over the rule of Basutoland&mdash;only,
of course, because the natives had &#8216;repeatedly implored&#8217; her to
do so.<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>  In 1871, the Witwatersrand diamond fields, or West
Griqualand, were seized from the Orange Free State and turned
into a Crown Colony. In 1879, Zululand was subjected, later to
become part of the Natal Colony; in 1885 followed the subjection
of Bechuanaland, to be joined to the Cape Colony. In 1888
Britain took over Matabele and Mashonaland, and in 1889
the British South Africa Company was given a Charter for both
these districts, again, of course, only to oblige the natives and
at their request.<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>  Between 1884 and 1887, Britain annexed St.
Lucia Bay and the entire East Coast as far as the Portuguese
possessions. In 1894, she subjected Tongaland. With their last
strength, the Matabele and Mashona fought one more desperate
battle, but the Company, with Rhodes at the head, first liquidated
the rising in blood and at once proceeded to the well-tried
measure for civilising and pacifying the natives: two large
railways were built in the rebellious district.</p>

<p>The Boer Republics were feeling increasingly uncomfortable
in this sudden stranglehold, and their internal affairs as well
were becoming completely disorganised. The overwhelming
influx of immigrants and the rising tides of the frenzied new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
capitalist economy now threatened to burst the barriers of the
small peasant states. There was indeed a blatant conflict between
agricultural and political peasant economy on the one
hand, and the demands and requirements of the accumulation
of capital on the other. In all respects, the republics were quite
unable to cope with these new problems. The constant danger
from the Kaffirs, no doubt regarded favourably by the British,
the unwieldy, primitive administration, the gradual corruption
of the <i>volksraad</i> in which the great capitalists got their way by
bribery, lack of a police force to keep the undisciplined crowds
of adventurers in some semblance of order, the absence of labour
legislation for regulating and securing the exploitation of the
Negroes in the mines, lack of water supplies and transport to
provide for the colony of 100,000 immigrants that had suddenly
sprung up, high protective tariffs which increased the cost of
labour for the capitalists, and high freights for coal&mdash;all these
factors combined towards the sudden and stunning bankruptcy
of the peasant republics.</p>

<p>They tried, obstinately and unimaginatively, to defend themselves
against the sudden eruption of capitalism which engulfed
them, with an incredibly crude measure, such as only a stubborn
and hide-bound peasant brain could have devised: they denied
all civic rights to the <i>uitlanders</i> who outnumbered them by far
and who stood for capital, power, and the trend of the time.
In those critical times it was an ill-omened trick. The mismanagement
of the peasant republics caused a considerable
reduction of dividends, on no account to be put up with. Mining
capital had come to the end of its tether. The British South
Africa Company built railroads, put down the Kaffirs,
organised revolts of the <i>uitlanders</i> and finally provoked the Boer
War. The bell had tolled for peasant economy. In the United
States, the economic revolution had begun with a war, in South
Africa war put the period to this chapter. Yet in both instances,
the outcome was the same: capital triumphed over the small
peasant economy which had in its turn come into being on the
ruins of natural economy, represented by the natives&#8217; primitive
organisations. The domination of capital was a foregone conclusion,
and it was just as hopeless for the Boer Republics to
resist as it had been for the American farmer. Capital officially
took over the reins in the new South African Union which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
replaced the small peasant republics by a great modern state,
as envisaged by Cecil Rhodes&#8217; imperialist programme. The new
conflict between capital and labour had superseded the old one
between British and Dutch. One million white exploiters of
both nations sealed their touching fraternal alliance within the
Union with the civil and political disfranchisement of five
million coloured workers. Not only the Negroes of the Boer
Republics came away empty-handed, but the natives of the
Cape Colony, whom the British government had at one time
granted political equality, were also deprived of some of their
rights. And this noble work, culminating under the imperialist
policy of the Conservatives in open oppression, was actually to
be finished by the Liberal Party itself, amid frenzied applause
from the &#8216;liberal cretins of Europe&#8217; who with sentimental pride
took as proof of the still continuing creative vigour and greatness
of English liberalism the fact that Britain had granted complete
self-government and freedom to a handful of whites in South
Africa.</p>

<p>The ruin of independent craftsmanship by capitalist competition,
no less painful for being soft-pedalled, deserves by
rights a chapter to itself. The most sinister part of such a
chapter would be out-work under capitalism;&mdash;but we need not
dwell on these phenomena here.</p>

<p>The general result of the struggle between capitalism and
simple commodity production is this: after substituting commodity
economy for natural economy, capital takes the place of
simple commodity economy. Non-capitalist organisations provide
a fertile soil for capitalism; more strictly: capital feeds on
the ruins of such organisations, and although this non-capitalist
<i>milieu</i> is indispensable for accumulation, the latter proceeds at
the cost of this medium nevertheless, by eating it up. Historically,
the accumulation of capital is a kind of metabolism
between capitalist economy and those pre-capitalist methods of
production without which it cannot go on and which, in this
light, it corrodes and assimilates. Thus capital cannot accumulate
without the aid of non-capitalist organisations, nor, on the
other hand, can it tolerate their continued existence side by side
with itself. Only the continuous and progressive disintegration
of non-capitalist organisations makes accumulation of capital
possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
The premises which are postulated in Marx&#8217;s diagram of
accumulation accordingly represent no more than the historical
tendency of the movement of accumulation and its logical conclusion.
The accumulative process endeavours everywhere to
substitute simple commodity economy for natural economy.
Its ultimate aim, that is to say, is to establish the exclusive and
universal domination of capitalist production in all countries
and for all branches of industry.</p>

<p>Yet this argument does not lead anywhere. As soon as this
final result is achieved&mdash;in theory, of course, because it can
never actually happen&mdash;accumulation must come to a stop.
The realisation and capitalisation of surplus value become impossible
to accomplish. Just as soon as reality begins to correspond
to Marx&#8217;s diagram of enlarged reproduction, the end of
accumulation is in sight, it has reached its limits, and capitalist
production is <i>in extremis</i>. For capital, the standstill of accumulation
means that the development of the productive forces is
arrested, and the collapse of capitalism follows inevitably, as
an objective historical necessity. This is the reason for the contradictory
behaviour of capitalism in the final stage of its
historical career: imperialism.</p>

<p>Marx&#8217;s diagram of enlarged reproduction thus does not conform
to the conditions of an accumulation in actual progress.
Progressive accumulation cannot be reduced to static interrelations
and interdependence between the two great departments
of social production (the departments of producer and
consumer goods), as the diagram would have it. Accumulation
is more than an internal relationship between the branches of
capitalist economy; it is primarily a relationship between capital
and a non-capitalist environment, where the two great departments
of production sometimes perform the accumulative process
on their own, independently of each other, but even then
at every step the movements overlap and intersect. From this
we get most complicated relations, divergencies in the speed and
direction of accumulation for the two departments, different
relations with non-capitalist modes of production as regards
both material elements and elements of value, which we cannot
possibly lay down in rigid formulæ. Marx&#8217;s diagram of accumulation
is only the theoretical reflection of the precise moment
when the domination of capital has reached its limits, and thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
it is no less a fiction than his diagram of simple reproduction,
which gives the theoretical formulation for the point of departure
of capitalist accumulation. The precise definition of capitalist
accumulation and its laws lies somewhere in between these

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXX</i></h2>

<h2>INTERNATIONAL LOANS</h2>

<p>The imperialist phase of capitalist accumulation which
implies universal competition comprises the industrialisation
and capitalist emancipation of the <i>hinterland</i> where
capital formerly realised its surplus value. Characteristic of this
phase are: lending abroad, railroad constructions, revolutions,
and wars. The last decade, from 1900 to 1910, shows in particular
the world-wide movement of capital, especially in Asia
and neighbouring Europe: in Russia, Turkey, Persia, India,
Japan, China, and also in North Africa. Just as the substitution
of commodity economy for a natural economy and that of
capitalist production for a simple commodity production was
achieved by wars, social crises and the destruction of entire social
systems, so at present the achievement of capitalist autonomy
in the <i>hinterland</i> and backward colonies is attained amidst wars
and revolutions. Revolution is an essential for the process of
capitalist emancipation. The backward communities must shed
their obsolete political organisations, relics of natural and simple
commodity economy, and create a modern state machinery
adapted to the purposes of capitalist production. The revolutions
in Turkey, Russia, and China fall under this heading. The
last two, in particular, do not exclusively serve the immediate
political requirements of capitalism; to some extent they carry
over outmoded pre-capitalist claims while on the other hand
they already embody new conflicts which run counter to the
domination of capital. These factors account for their immense
drive, but at the same time impede and delay the ultimate
victory of the revolutionary forces. A young state will usually
sever the leading strings of older capitalist states by wars, which
temper and test the modern state&#8217;s capitalist independence in
a baptism by fire. That is why military together with financial
reforms invariably herald the bid for economic independence.</p>

<p>The forward-thrusts of capital are approximately reflected in
the development of the railway network. The permanent way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
grew most quickly in Europe during the forties, in America in
the fifties, in Asia in the sixties, in Australia during the seventies
and eighties, and during the nineties in Africa.<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>Public loans for railroad building and armaments accompany
all stages of the accumulation of capital: the introduction of
commodity economy, industrialisation of countries, capitalist
revolutionisation of agriculture as well as the emancipation of
young capitalist states. For the accumulation of capital, the loan
has various functions: (<i>a</i>) it serves to convert the money of non-capitalist
groups into capital, i.e. money both as a commodity
equivalent (lower middle-class savings) and as fund of consumption
for the hangers-on of the capitalist class; (<i>b</i>) it serves
to transform money capital into productive capital by means
of state enterprise&mdash;railroad building and military supplies; (<i>c</i>)
it serves to divert accumulated capital from the old capitalist
countries to young ones. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
the loan transferred capital from the Italian cities to
England, in the eighteenth century from Holland to England,
in the nineteenth century from England to the American
Republics and Australia, from France, Germany and Belgium
to Russia, and at the present time [1912] from Germany to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
Turkey, from England, Germany and France to China, and,
via Russia, to Persia.</p>

<p>In the Imperialist Era, the foreign loan played an outstanding
part as a means for young capitalist states to acquire independence.
The contradictions inherent in the modern system of
foreign loans are the concrete expression of those which characterise
the imperialist phase. Though foreign loans are indispensable
for the emancipation of the rising capitalist states,
they are yet the surest ties by which the old capitalist states
maintain their influence, exercise financial control and exert
pressure on the customs, foreign and commercial policy of the
young capitalist states. Pre-eminently channels for the investment
in new spheres of capital accumulated in the old countries,
such loans widen the scope for the accumulation of capital; but
at the same time they restrict it by creating new competition for
the investing countries.</p>

<p>These inherent conflicts of the international loan system are
a classic example of spatio-temporal divergencies between the
conditions for the realisation of surplus value and the capitalisation
thereof. While realisation of the surplus value requires only
the general spreading of commodity production, its capitalisation
demands the progressive supercession of simple commodity
production by capitalist economy, with the corollary that the
limits to both the realisation and the capitalisation of surplus
value keep contracting ever more. Employment of international
capital in the construction of the international railway network
reflects this disparity. Between the thirties and the sixties of the
nineteenth century, railway building and the loans necessary for
it mainly served to oust natural economy, and to spread commodity
economy&mdash;as in the case of the Russian railway loans in
the sixties, or in that of the American railways which were built
with European capital. Railway construction in Africa and
Asia during the last twenty years, on the other hand, almost
exclusively served the purposes of an imperialist policy, of
economic monopolisation and economic subjugation of the backward
communities. As regards Russia&#8217;s railroad construction in
Eastern Asia, for instance, it is common knowledge that Russia
had paved the way for the military occupation of Manchuria
by sending troops to protect her engineers working on the Manchurian
railway. With the same object in view, Russia obtained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
railway concessions in Persia, Germany in Asia Minor and
Mesopotamia, and Britain and Germany in Africa.</p>

<p>In this connection, we must deal with a misunderstanding
concerning the capital investments in foreign countries and the
demand of these countries for capital imports. Already in the
early twenties of the last century, the export of British capital to
America played an important part, being largely responsible for
the first genuine industrial and commercial crises in England in
1825. Since 1824, the London stock exchange had been flooded
with South American stocks and shares. During the following
year, the newly created states of South and Central America
raised loans in London alone for more than £20,000,000, and in
addition, enormous quantities of South American industrial
shares and similar bonds were sold. This sudden prosperity and
the opening up of the South American markets in their turn
called forth greatly increased exports of British commodities
to the Latin Americas. British commodity exports to these
countries amounted to £2,900,000 in 1821 which had risen to
£6,400,000 by 1825.</p>

<p>Cotton textiles formed the most important item of these
exports; this powerful demand was the impetus for a rapid
expansion of British cotton production, and many new factories
were opened. In 1821, raw cotton to the value of £m. 129 was
made up in England, and in 1826 the amount had risen to
£m. 167.</p>

<p>The situation was thus fraught with the elements of a crisis.
Tugan Baranovski raises the question: &#8216;But from where did the
South American countries take the means to buy twice as many
commodities in 1825 as in 1821? The British themselves supplied
these means. The loans floated on the London stock exchange
served as payment for imported goods. Deceived by the demand
they had themselves created, the British factory-owners were
soon brought to realise by their own experience that their high
expectations had been unfounded.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>He thus characterises as &#8216;deceptive&#8217;, as an unhealthy, abnormal
economic phenomenon the fact that the South American demand
for English goods had been brought about by British capital.
Thus uncritically he took over the doctrine of an expert with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
whose other theories he wished to have nothing in common. The
opinion had been advanced already during the English crisis
of 1825 that it could be explained by the &#8216;singular&#8217; development
of the relations between British capital and South American
demand. None other than Sismondi had raised the same question
as Tugan Baranovski and given a most accurate description
of events in the second edition of his <i>Nouveaux Principes</i>:</p>

<p>&#8216;The opening up of the immense market afforded by Spanish
America to industrial producers seemed to offer a good opportunity
to relieve British manufacture. The British government
were of that opinion, and in the seven years following the crisis
of 1818, displayed unheard-of activity to carry English commerce
to penetrate the remotest districts of Mexico, Columbia,
Brazil, Rio de la Plata, Chile and Peru. Before the government
decided to recognise these new states, it had to protect English
commerce by frequent calls of battleships whose captains had a
diplomatic rather than a military mission. In consequence, it
had defied the clamours of the Holy Alliance and recognised the
new republics at a moment when the whole of Europe, on the
contrary, was plotting their ruin. But however big the demand
afforded by free America, yet it would not have been enough
to absorb all the goods England had produced over and above
the needs of consumption, had not their means for buying English
merchandise been suddenly increased beyond all bounds by
the loans to the new republics. Every American state borrowed
from England an amount sufficient to consolidate its government.
Although they were capital loans, they were immediately
spent in the course of the year like income, that is to say they
were used up entirely to buy English goods on behalf of the
treasury, or to pay for those which had been dispatched on
private orders. At the same time, numerous companies with
immense capitals were formed to exploit all the American mines,
but all the money they spent found its way back to England,
either to pay for the machinery which they immediately used,
or else for the goods sent to the localities where they were to
work. As long as this singular commerce lasted, in which the
English only asked the Americans to be kind enough to buy
English merchandise with English capital, and to consume them
for their sake, the prosperity of English manufacture appeared
dazzling. It was no more income but rather English capital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
which was used to push on consumption: the English themselves
bought and paid for their own goods which they sent to
America, and thereby merely forwent the pleasure of using
these goods.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p>From this Sismondi drew the characteristic conclusion that
the real limits to the capitalist market are set by income, i.e. by
personal consumption alone, and he used this example as one
more warning against accumulation.</p>

<p>Down to the present day, the events which preceded the crisis
of 1825 have remained typical for a period of boom and expansion
of capital, and such &#8216;singular commerce&#8217; is in fact one of
the most important foundations of the accumulation of capital.
Particularly in the history of British capital, it occurs regularly
before every crisis, as Tugan Baranovski himself showed by the
following facts and figures: the immediate cause of the 1836
crisis was the flooding of the American market with British
goods, again financed by British money. In 1834, U.S. commodity
imports exceeded exports by £m. 1·2 but at the same
time their imports of precious metal exceeded exports by
nearly £m. 3·2. Even in 1836, the year of the crisis itself, their
surplus of imported commodities amounted to £m. 10·4, and
still the excess of bullion imported was £m. 1. This influx of
money, no less than the stream of goods, came chiefly from
England, where U.S. railway shares were bought in bulk.
1835/6 saw the opening in the United States of sixty-one new
banks with a capital of £m. 10·4, predominantly British. Again,
the English paid for their exports themselves. The unprecedented
industrial boom in the Northern States of the Union, eventually
leading to the Civil War, was likewise financed by British
capital, which again created an expanding market for British
industry in the United States.</p>

<p>And not only British capital&mdash;other European capitals also
made every possible effort to take part in this &#8216;singular commerce&#8217;.
To quote Schaeffle, in the five years between 1849 and
1854, at least £m. 100 were invested in American shares on the
various stock exchanges of Europe. The simultaneous revival of
world industry attained such dimensions that it culminated in
the world crash of 1857.&mdash;In the sixties, British capital lost no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
time in creating similar conditions in Asia as well as the United
States. An unending stream was diverted to Asia Minor and
East India, where it financed the most magnificent railroad projects.
The permanent way of British India amounted in 1860
to 844 miles, in 1870 to 4,802 miles, in 1880 to 9,361 miles and
in 1890 to 16,875 miles. This at once increased the demand for
British commodities. No sooner had the War of Secession come
to a close, than British capital again flowed into the United
States. It again paid for the greater part of the enormous railroad
constructions in the Union during the sixties and seventies,
the permanent way amounting in 1850 to 8,844 miles, in 1860
to 30,807 miles, in 1870 to 53,212 miles, in 1880 to 94,198 miles,
and in 1890 to 179,005 miles. Materials for these railways were
also being supplied by England&mdash;one of the main causes for the
rapid development of the British coal and iron industries and
the reasons why these industries were so seriously affected by
the American crises of 1866, 1873 and 1884. What Sismondi
considered sheer lunacy was in this instance literally true: the
British with their own materials, their own iron etc., had built
railroads in the United States, they had paid for the railways
with their own capital and only forwent their &#8216;use&#8217;. In spite of
all periodical crises, however, European capital had acquired
such a taste for this madness, that the London stock exchange
was seized by a veritable epidemic of foreign loans in the middle
of the seventies. Between 1870 and 1875, loans of this kind,
amounting to £m. 260, were raised in London. The immediate
consequence was a rapid increase in the overseas export of
British merchandise. Although the foreign countries concerned
went periodically bankrupt, masses of capital continued to flow
in. Turkey, Egypt, Greece, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras,
Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, St. Domingo, Uruguay, and
Venezuela completely or partially suspended their payments of
interest in the late seventies. Yet undeterred by this, the fever
for exotic state loans burst out again at the end of the eighties&mdash;the
South American states and South African colonies were
lent immense quantities of European capital. In 1874, for instance,
the Argentine Republic borrowed as much as £m. 10
and the loan had risen to £m. 59 by 1890.</p>

<p>England built railways with her own iron and coal in all these
countries as well, paying for them with her own capital. In 1885,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
the Argentine permanent way had been 1,952 miles, in 1893 it
was 8,557 miles.</p>

<p>Exports from England were rising accordingly:</p>

</table></div>

<p>British total exports (mainly to the Argentine) amounted to
£m. 4·7 in 1885 and to £m. 10·7 a mere four years later.</p>

<p>At the same time, British capital flowed into Australia in
the form of state loans. At the end of the eighties the loans
to the three colonies Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania
amounted to £m. 112, £m. 81 of which were invested in railway
construction. The permanent way of Australia extended
over 4,900 miles in 1880, and over 15,600 miles in 1895.</p>

<p>Britain, supplying capital and materials for these railways,
was also embroiled in the crises of 1890 in the Argentine, Transvaal,
Mexico, Uruguay, and in that of 1893 in Australia.</p>

<p>The following two decades made a difference only in so far
as German, French and Belgian capital largely participated
with British capital in foreign investments, while railway construction
in Asia Minor had been financed entirely by British
capital from the fifties to the late eighties. From then on, German
capital took over and put into execution the tremendous
project of the Anatolian railway. German capital investments in
Turkey gave rise to an increased export of German goods to that
country.</p>

<p>In 1896, German exports to Turkey amounted to £m. 1·4,
in 1911 to £m. 5·65. To Asiatic Turkey, in particular, goods
were exported in 1901 to the value of £m. 0·6 and in 1911 to the
value of £m. 1·85. In this case, German capital was used to a
considerable extent to pay for German goods, the Germans
forgoing, to use Sismondi&#8217;s term, only the pleasure of using
their own products.</p>

<p>Let us examine the position more closely:</p>

<p>Realised surplus value, which cannot be capitalised and lies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
idle in England or Germany, is invested in railway construction,
water works, etc. in the Argentine, Australia, the Cape Colony
or Mesopotamia. Machinery, materials and the like are supplied
by the country where the capital has originated, and the same
capital pays for them. Actually, this process characterises capitalist
conditions everywhere, even at home. Capital must purchase
the elements of production and thus become productive
capital before it can operate. Admittedly, the products are then
used within the country, while in the former case they are used
by foreigners. But then capitalist production does not aim at
its products being enjoyed, but at the accumulation of surplus
value. There had been no demand for the surplus product
within the country, so capital had lain idle without the possibility
of accumulating. But abroad, where capitalist production
has not yet developed, there has come about, voluntarily or by
force, a new demand of the non-capitalist strata. The consumption
of the capitalist and working classes at home is irrelevant for
the purposes of accumulation, and what matters to capital is
the very fact that its products are &#8216;used&#8217; by <i>others</i>. The new consumers
must indeed realise the products, pay for their use, and
for this they need money. They can obtain some of it by the
exchange of commodities which begins at this point, a brisk
traffic in goods following hard on the heels of railway construction
and mining (gold mines, etc.). Thus the capital advanced
for railroad building and mining, together with an additional
surplus value, is gradually realised. It is immaterial to the situation
as a whole whether this exported capital becomes share
capital in new independent enterprises, or whether, as a government
loan, it uses the mediation of a foreign state to find new
scope for operation in industry and traffic, nor does it matter if
in the first case some of the companies are fraudulent and fail
in due course, or if in the second case the borrowing state finally
goes bankrupt, i.e. if the owners sometimes lose part of their
capital in one way or another. Even the country of origin is not
immune, and individual capitals frequently get lost in crises.
The important point is that capital accumulated in the old
country should find elsewhere new opportunities to beget and
realise surplus value, so that accumulation can proceed. In the
new countries, large regions of natural economy are open to
conversion into commodity economy, or existing commodity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
economy can be ousted by capital. Railroad construction and
mining, gold mining in particular, are typical for the investment
of capitals from old capitalist countries in new ones. They
are pre-eminently qualified to stimulate a brisk traffic in goods
under conditions hitherto determined by natural economy and
both are significant in economic history as mile-stones along
the route of rapid dissolution of old economic organisations, of
social crises and of the development of modern conditions, that
is to say of the development of commodity economy to begin
with, and further of the production of capital.</p>

<p>For this reason, the part played by lending abroad as well
as by capital investments in foreign railway and mining shares
is a fine sample of the deficiencies in Marx&#8217;s diagram of accumulation.
In these instances, enlarged reproduction of capital
capitalises a surplus value that has already been realised (in so
far as the loans or foreign investments are not financed by the
savings of the petty bourgeoisie or the semi-proletariat). It is
quite irrelevant to the present field of accumulation, when,
where and how the capital of the old countries has been realised
so that it may flow into the new country. British capital which
finds an outlet in Argentine railway construction might well in
the past have been realised in China in the form of Indian opium.
Further, the British capital which builds railways in the Argentine,
is of English origin not only in its pure value-form, as
money capital, but also in its material form, as iron, coal and
machinery; the use-form of the surplus value, that is to say,
has also come into being from the very beginning in the use-form
suitable for the purposes of accumulation. The actual
use-form of the variable capital, however, labour power, is
mainly foreign: it is the native labour of the new countries
which is made a new object of exploitation by the capital of the
old countries. If we want to keep our investigation all on one
plane, we may even assume that the labour power, too, has the
same country of origin as the capital. In point of fact new discoveries,
of gold mines for instance, tend to call forth mass
emigration from the old countries, especially in the first stages,
and are largely worked by labour from those countries. It might
well be, then, that in a new country capital, labour power and
means of production all come from the same capitalist country,
say England. So it is really in England that all the material
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
conditions for accumulation exist&mdash;a realised surplus value as
money capital, a surplus product in productive form, and lastly
labour reserves. Yet accumulation cannot proceed here: England
and her old buyers require neither railways nor an expanded
industry. Enlarged reproduction, i.e. accumulation, is
possible only if new districts with a non-capitalist civilisation,
extending over large areas, appear on the scene and augment
the number of consumers.</p>

<p>But then, who are these new consumers actually; who is it
that realises the surplus value of capitalist enterprises which are
started with foreign loans; and who, in the final analysis, pays
for these loans? The international loans in Egypt provide a
classical answer.</p>

<p>The internal history of Egypt in the second half of the nineteenth
century is characterised by the interplay of three phenomena:
large-scale capitalist enterprise, a rapidly growing public
debt, and the collapse of peasant economy. Until quite recently,
<i>corvée</i> prevailed in Egypt, and the Wali and later the Khedive
freely pursued their own power policy with regard to the condition
of landownership. These primitive conditions precisely
offered an incomparably fertile soil for the operations of European
capital. Economically speaking, the conditions for a monetary
economy had to be established to begin with, and the state
created them by direct compulsion. Until the thirties, Mehemet
Ali, the founder of Modern Egypt, here applied a method of
patriarchal simplicity: every year, he &#8216;bought up&#8217; the fellaheen&#8217;s
entire harvest for the public exchequer, and allowed them to
buy back, at a higher price, a minimum for subsistence and seed.
In addition he imported cotton from East India, sugar cane
from America, indigo and pepper, and issued the fellaheen with
official directions what to plant and how much of it. The
government again claimed the monopoly for cotton and indigo,
reserving to itself the exclusive right of buying and selling these
goods. By such methods was commodity exchange introduced in
Egypt. Admittedly, Mehemet Ali also did something towards
raising labour productivity. He arranged for dredging of the
ancient canalisation, and above all he started the work of the
great Kaliub Nile dams which initiated the series of great capitalist
enterprises in Egypt. These were to comprise four great
fields: (1) irrigation systems, in which the Kaliub works built
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
between 1845 and 1853 take first place&mdash;quite apart from
unpaid forced labour, they swallowed up £m. 2·5 and incidentally
proved quite useless at first; (2) routes for traffic&mdash;the most
important construction which proved ultimately detrimental
to Egypt being the Suez Canal; (3) the cultivation of cotton,
and (4) the production of sugar cane. With the building of the
Suez Canal, Egypt became caught up in the web of European
capitalism, never again to get free of it. French capital led the
way with British capital hard on its heels. In the twenty years
that followed, the internal disturbances in Egypt were coloured
by the competitive struggle between these two capitals. French
capital was perhaps the most peculiar exponent of the European
methods of capital accumulation at the expense of primitive
conditions. Its operations were responsible for the useless Nile
dams as well as for the Suez Canal. Egypt first contracted to
supply the labour of 20,000 serfs free of charge for a number of
years, and secondly to take up shares in the Suez Company to
the tune of £m. 3·5, i.e. 40 per cent of the company&#8217;s total
capital. All this for the sake of breaking through a canal which
would deflect the entire trade between Europe and Asia from
Egypt and would painfully affect her part in this trade. These
£m. 3·5 formed the nucleus for Egypt&#8217;s immense national debt
which was to bring about her military occupation by Britain
twenty years later. In the irrigation system, sudden transformations
were initiated: the ancient <i>sakias</i>, i.e. bullock-driven
water-wheels, of which 50,000 had been busy for 7 months in
the year in the Nile delta alone, were partially replaced by
steam pumps. Modern steamers now plied on the Nile between
Cairo and Assuan. But the most profound change in the
economic conditions of Egypt was brought about by the cultivation
of cotton. This became almost epidemic in Egypt when,
owing to the American War of Secession and the English cotton
famine, the price per short ton rose from something between
£30 and £40 to £200-£250. Everybody was planting cotton,
and foremost among all, the Viceroy and his family. His estates
grew fat, what with large-scale land robbery, confiscations,
forced &#8216;sale&#8217; or plain theft. He suddenly appropriated villages
by the score though without any legal excuse. Within an incredibly
short time, this vast demesne was brought under
cotton, with the result that the entire technique of Egyptian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
traditional agriculture was revolutionised. Dams were thrown
up everywhere to protect the cotton fields from the seasonal
flooding of the Nile, and a comprehensive system of artificial
irrigation was introduced. These waterworks together with continuous
deep ploughing&mdash;a novel departure for the fellah who
had until then merely scratched his soil with a plough dating
back to the Pharaohs&mdash;and finally the intensive labours of the
harvest made between them enormous demands on Egypt&#8217;s
labour power. This was throughout the same forced peasant
labour over which the state claimed to have an unrestricted
right of disposal; and thousands had already been employed on
the Kaliub dams and the Suez Canal and now the irrigation and
plantation work to be done on the viceregal estates clamoured
for this forced labour. The 20,000 serfs who had been put at the
disposal of the Suez Canal Company were now required by the
Khedive himself, and this brought about the first clash with
French capital. The company was adjudged a compensation of
£m. 3·35 by the arbitration of Napoleon III, a settlement to
which the Khedive could all the more readily agree, since the
very fellaheen whose labour power was the bone of contention
were ultimately to be mulcted of this sum. The work of irrigation
was immediately put in hand. Centrifugal machines, steam
and traction engines were therefore ordered from England and
France. In their hundreds, they were carried by steamers from
England to Alexandria and then further. Steam ploughs were
needed for cultivating the soil, especially since the rinderpest
of 1864 had killed off all the cattle, England again being the
chief supplier of these machines. The Fowler works were expanded
enormously of a sudden to meet the requirements of the
Viceroy for which Egypt had to pay.<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
But now Egypt required yet a third type of machine, cotton
gins and presses for packing. Dozens of these gins were set up in
the Delta towns. Like English industrial towns, Sagasis, Tanta,
Samanud and other towns were covered by palls of smoke
and great fortunes circulated in the banks of Alexandria and
Cairo.</p>

<p>But already in the year that followed, this cotton speculation
collapsed with the cotton prices which fell in a couple of days
from 27<i>d.</i> per pound to 15<i>d.</i>, 12<i>d.</i>, and finally 6<i>d.</i> after the cessation
of hostilities in the American Union. The following year, Ismail
Pasha ventured on a new speculation, the production of cane
sugar. The forced labour of the fellaheen was to compete with
the Southern States of the Union where slavery had been
abolished. For the second time, Egyptian agriculture was turned
upside down. French and British capitalists found a new field
for rapid accumulation. 18 giant sugar factories were put on
order in 1868-9 with an estimated daily output of 200 short
tons of sugar, that is to say four times as much as that of the
greatest then existing plant. Six of them were ordered from
England, and twelve from France, but England eventually
delivered the lion&#8217;s share, because of the Franco-German war.
These factories were to be built along the Nile at intervals of
6·2 miles (10 <i>km.</i>), as centres of cane plantations of an area comprising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
10 sq. <i>km.</i> Working to full capacity, each factory required
a daily supply of 2,000 tons of sugar cane. Fellaheen were driven
to forced labour on the sugar plantations in their thousands,
while further thousands of their number built the Ibrahimya
Canal. The stick and <i>kourbash</i> were unstintingly applied.
Transport soon became a problem. A railway network had to
be built round every factory to haul the masses of cane inside,
rolling stock, funiculars, etc., had to be obtained as quickly as
possible. Again these enormous orders were placed with English
capital. The first giant factory was opened in 1872, 4,000 camels
providing makeshift transport. But it proved to be simply impossible
to supply cane in the quantities required by the undertaking.
The working staff was completely inadequate, since the
fellah, accustomed to forced labour on the land, could not be
transformed overnight into a modern industrial worker by the
lash of the whip. The venture collapsed, even before many of
the imported machines had been installed. This sugar speculation
concluded the period of gigantic capitalist enterprise in
Egypt in 1873.</p>

<p>What had provided the capital for these enterprises? International
loans. One year before his death in 1863, Said Pasha
had raised the first loan at a nominal value of £m. 3·3 which
came to £m. 2·5 in cash after deduction of commissions, discounts,
etc. He left to Ismail Pasha the legacy of this debt and
the contract with the Suez Canal Company, which was to
burden Egypt with a debt of £m. 17. Ismail Pasha in turn
raised his first loan in 1864 with a nominal value of £m. 5·7
at 7 per cent and a cash value of £m. 4·85 at <span class="fraction" title="8 and 1 quarter">8<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></span> per cent. What
remained of it, after £m. 3·35 had been paid to the Suez Canal
Company as compensation, was spent within the year, swallowed
up for the greater part by the cotton gamble. In 1865,
the first so-called Daira-loan was floated by the Anglo-Egyptian
Bank, on the security of the Khedive&#8217;s private estates. The
nominal value of this loan was £m. 3·4 at 9 per cent, and its
real value £m. 2·5 at 12 per cent. In 1866, <i>Fruehling &amp; Goschen</i>
floated a new loan at a nominal value of £m. 3 and a cash
value of £m. 2. The Ottoman Bank floated another in 1867 of
nominally £m. 2, really £m. 1·7. The floating debt at that time
amounted to £m. 30. The Banking House <i>Oppenheim &amp; Neffen</i>
floated a great loan in 1868 to consolidate part of this debt. Its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
nominal value was £m. 11·9 at 7 per cent, though Ismail could
actually lay hands only on £m. 7·1 at <span class="fraction" title="13 and 1 half">13<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></span> per cent. This money
made it possible, however, to pay for the pompous celebrations
on the opening of the Suez Canal, in presence of the leading
figures in the Courts of Europe, in finance and in the <i>demi-monde</i>,
for a madly lavish display, and further, to grease the palm of
the Turkish Overlord, the Sultan, with a new baksheesh of
£m. 1. The sugar gamble necessitated another loan in 1870.
Floated by the firm of <i>Bischoffsheim &amp; Goldschmidt</i>, it had a
nominal value of £m. 7·1 at 7 per cent, and its cash value was
£m. 5. In 1872/3 <i>Oppenheim&#8217;s</i> floated two further loans, a modest
one amounting to £m. 4 at 14 per cent and a large one of
£m. 32 at 8 per cent which reduced the floating debt by one-half,
but which actually came only to £m. 11 in cash, since the
European banking houses paid it in part by bills of exchange
they had discounted.</p>

<p>In 1874, a further attempt was made to raise a national loan
of £m. 50 at an annual charge of 9 per cent, but it yielded
no more than £m. 3·4. Egyptian securities were quoted at
54 per cent of their face value. Within the thirteen years
after Said Pasha&#8217;s death, Egypt&#8217;s total public debt had
grown from £m. 3·293 to £m. 94·110,<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>  and collapse was
imminent.</p>

<p>These operations of capital, at first sight, seem to reach the
height of madness. One loan followed hard on the other, the
interest on old loans was defrayed by new loans, and capital
borrowed from the British and French paid for the large orders
placed with British and French industrial capital.</p>

<p>While the whole of Europe sighed and shrugged its shoulders
at Ismail&#8217;s crazy economy, European capital was in fact doing
business in Egypt on a unique and fantastic scale&mdash;an incredible
modern version of the biblical legend about the fat kine which
remains unparalleled in capitalist history.</p>

<p>In the first place, there was an element of usury in every
loan, anything between one-fifth and one-third of the money
ostensibly lent sticking to the fingers of the European bankers.
Ultimately, the exorbitant interest had to be paid somehow, but
how&mdash;where were the means to come from? Egypt herself was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
to supply them; their source was the Egyptian fellah&mdash;peasant
economy providing in the final analysis all the most important
elements for large-scale capitalist enterprise. He provided the
land since the so-called private estates of the Khedive were
quickly growing to vast dimensions by robbery and blackmail
of innumerable villages; and these estates were the foundations
of the irrigation projects and the speculation in cotton and sugar
cane. As forced labour, the fellah also provided the labour
power and, what is more, he was exploited without payment and
even had to provide his own means of subsistence while he was
at work. The marvels of technique which European engineers
and European machines performed in the sphere of Egyptian
irrigation, transport, agriculture and industry were due to
this peasant economy with its fellaheen serfs. On the Kaliub
Nile dams and on the Suez Canal, in the cotton plantations and
in the sugar plants, untold masses of peasants were put to work;
they were switched over from one job to the next as the need
arose, and they were exploited to the limit of endurance and
beyond. Although it became evident at every step that there
were technical limits to the employment of forced labour for
the purposes of modern capital, yet this was amply compensated
by capital&#8217;s unrestricted power of command over the pool of
labour power, how long and under what conditions men were
to work, live and be exploited.</p>

<p>But not alone that it supplied land and labour power, peasant
economy also provided the money. Under the influence of
capitalist economy, the screws were put on the fellaheen by
taxation. The tax on peasant holdings was persistently increased.
In the late sixties, it amounted to £2 5<i>s.</i> per <i>hectare</i>, but not a
farthing was levied on the enormous private estates of the royal
family. In addition, ever more special rates were devised.
Contributions of 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per <i>hectare</i> had to be paid for the
maintenance of the irrigation system which almost exclusively
benefited the royal estates, and the fellah had to pay 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for
every date tree felled, 9<i>d.</i> for every clay hovel in which he lived.
In addition, every male over 10 years of age was liable to a head
tax of 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The total paid by the fellaheen was £m. 2·5 under
Mehemet Ali, £m. 5 under Said Pasha, and £m. 8·15 under
Ismail Pasha.</p>

<p>The greater the debt to European capital became, the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
had to be extorted from the peasants.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>  In 1869 all taxes were
put up by 10 per cent and the taxes for the coming year collected
in advance. In 1870, a supplementary land tax of 8<i>s.</i> per
<i>hectare</i> was levied. All over Upper Egypt people were leaving
the villages, demolished their dwellings and no longer tilled
their land&mdash;only to avoid payment of taxes. In 1876, the tax
on date palms was increased by 6<i>d.</i> Whole villages went out to
fell their date palms and had to be prevented by rifle volleys.
North of Siut, 10,000 fellaheen are said to have starved in 1879
because they could no longer raise the irrigation tax for their
fields and had killed their cattle to avoid paying tax on it.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<p>Now the fellah had been drained of his last drop of blood.
Used as a leech by European capital, the Egyptian state had
accomplished its function and was no longer needed. Ismail, the
Khedive, was given his <i>congé</i>; capital could begin winding up
operations.</p>

<p>Egypt had still to pay 394,000 Egyptian pounds as interest on
the Suez Canal shares for £m. 4 which England had bought in
1875. Now British commissions to &#8216;regulate&#8217; the finances of
Egypt went into action. Strangely enough, European capital
was not at all deterred by the desperate state of the insolvent
country and offered again and again to grant immense loans
for the salvation of Egypt. Cowe and Stokes proposed a loan
of £m. 76 at 9 per cent for the conversion of the total debt,
Rivers Wilson thought no less than £m. 103 would be necessary.
The <i>Crédit Foncier</i> bought up floating bills of exchange by the
million, attempting, though without success, to consolidate the
total debt by a loan of £m. 91. With the financial position growing
hopelessly desperate, the time drew near when the country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
and all her productive forces was to become the prey of European
capital. October 1878 saw the representatives of the
European creditors landing in Alexandria. British and French
capital established dual control of finances and devised new
taxes; the peasants were beaten and oppressed, so that payment
of interest, temporarily suspended in 1876, could be resumed
in 1877.<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>Now the claims of European capital became the pivot of
economic life and the sole consideration of the financial system.
In 1878, a new commission and ministry were set up, both with
a staff in which Europeans made up one half. In 1879, the
finances of Egypt were brought under permanent control of
European capital, exercised by the <i>Commission de la Dette Publique
Égyptienne</i> in Cairo. In 1878, the Tshifliks, estates of the
viceregal family, which comprised 431,100 acres, were converted
into crown land and pledged to the European capitalists
as collateral for the public debt, and the same happened to the
Daira lands, the private estates of the Khedive, comprising
485,131 acres, mainly in Upper Egypt; this was, at a later date,
sold to a syndicate. The other estates for the greatest part fell to
capitalist companies, the Suez Canal Company in particular.
To cover the cost of occupation, England requisitioned ecclesiastical
lands of the mosques and schools. An opportune pretext
for the final blow was provided by a mutiny in the Egyptian
army, starved under European financial control while European
officials were drawing excellent salaries, and by a revolt engineered
among the Alexandrian masses who had been bled white.
The British military occupied Egypt in 1882, as a result of
twenty years&#8217; operations of Big Business, never to leave again.
This was the ultimate and final step in the process of liquidating
peasant economy in Egypt by and for European capital.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
It should now be clear that the transactions between European
loan capital and European industrial capital are based
upon relations which are extremely rational and &#8216;sound&#8217; for the
accumulation of capital, although they appear absurd to the
casual observer because this loan capital pays for the orders
from Egypt and the interest on one loan is paid out of a new
loan. Stripped of all obscuring connecting links, these relations
consist in the simple fact that European capital has largely
swallowed up the Egyptian peasant economy. Enormous tracts
of land, labour, and labour products without number, accruing
to the state as taxes, have ultimately been converted into European
capital and have been accumulated. Evidently, only by
use of the <i>kourbash</i> could the historical development which would
normally take centuries be compressed into two or three decades,
and it was just the primitive nature of Egyptian conditions
which proved such fertile soil for the accumulation of capital.</p>

<p>As against the fantastic increase of capital on the one hand,
the other economic result is the ruin of peasant economy together
with the growth of commodity exchange which is rooted
in the supreme exertion of the country&#8217;s productive forces.
Under Ismail&#8217;s rule, the arable and reclaimed land of Egypt
grew from 5 to 6·75 million acres, the canal system from 45,625
to 54,375 miles and the permanent way from 256·25 to 1,638
miles. Docks were built in Siut and Alexandria, magnificent
dockyards in Alexandria, a steamer-service for pilgrims to
Mecca was introduced on the Red Sea and along the coast of
Syria and Asia Minor. Egypt&#8217;s exports which in 1861 had
amounted to £4,450,000 rose to £m. 14·4 in 1864; her imports
which under Said Pasha amounted to £m 1·2 rose under Ismail
to between £m. 5 and £m. 5·5. Trade which recovered only in
the eighties from the opening up of the Suez Canal amounted
to £m. 8·15 worth of imports and £m. 12·45 worth of exports
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
in 1890, but in 1900 the figures were £m. 144 for imports and
£m. 12·25 for exports, and in 1911&mdash;£m. 27·85 for imports and
£m. 26·85 for exports. Thanks to this development of commodity
economy which expanded by leaps and bounds with the
assistance of European capital, Egypt herself had fallen a prey
to the latter. The case of Egypt, just as that of China and, more
recently, Morocco, shows militarism as the executor of the
accumulation of capital, lurking behind international loans,
railroad building, irrigation systems, and similar works of
civilisation. The Oriental states cannot develop from natural to
commodity economy and further to capitalist economy fast
enough and are swallowed up by international capital, since
they cannot perform these transformations without selling their
souls to capital. Their feverish metamorphoses are tantamount
to their absorption by international capital.</p>

<p>Another good recent example is the deal made by German
capital in Asiatic Turkey. European capital, British capital in
particular, had already at an early date attempted to gain
possession of this area which marches with the ancient trade
route between Europe and Asia.<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>In the fifties and sixties, British capital built the railway
lines Smyrna-Aydin-Diner and Smyrna-Kassaba-Alasehir,
obtained the concession to extend the line to Afyon Karahisar
and also leased the first tract for the Anatolian railway Ada-Bazar-Izmid.
French capital gradually came to acquire influence
over part of the railway building during this time. In
1888, German capital appeared on the scene. It took up 60 per
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
cent of the shares in the new merger of international interests,
negotiated principally with the French capitalist group represented
by the <i>Banque Ottomane</i>. International capital took up
the remaining 40 per cent.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>  The Anatolian Railway Company,
a Turkish company, was founded on the 14th Redsheb of the
year 1306 (March 4, 1889) with the <i>Deutsche Bank</i> for principal
backer, to take over the railway lines between Ada-Bazar and
Izmid, running since the early seventies, as also the concession
for the Izmid-Eskisehir-Angora line (525 miles). It was further
entitled to complete the Ada-Bazar-Scutari line and branch
lines to Brussa, in addition to building the supplementary network
Eskisehir-Konya (278 miles) on the basis of the 1893 concession,
and finally to run a service from Angora to Kaisari
(264 miles). The Turkish government gave the company a state
guarantee of annual gross earnings amounting to £412 per km.
on the Ada-Bazar line and of £600 per km. on the Izmid-Angora
lines. For this purpose it wrote over to the <i>Administration
de la Dette Publique Ottomane</i> the revenue from tithes in the <i>sandshaks</i>
of Izmid, Ertoghrul, Kutalia and Angora, with which to
make up the gross earnings guaranteed by the government. For
the Angora-Kaisari line the government guaranteed annual
gross earnings of 775 Turkish pounds, i.e. £712 per km., and
604 Turkish pounds, i.e. approximately £550, provided, in the
latter case, that the supplementary grant per km. did not exceed
219 Turkish pounds (£200 a year). The government was to
receive a quarter of the eventual surplus of gross earnings over
the guaranteed amount. The <i>Administration de la Dette Publique
Ottomane</i> as executor of the government guarantee collected the
tithes of the <i>sandshaks</i> Trebizonde and Gumuchhane direct and
paid the railway company out of a common fund which was
formed of all the tithes set aside for this purpose. In 1898, the
Eskisehir-Konya maximum grant was raised from 218 to 296
Turkish pounds.</p>

<p>In 1899, the company obtained concessions to build and run
a dockyard at Ada-Bazar, to issue writs, to build corn-elevators
and storerooms for goods of every description, further the right
to employ its own staff for loading and unloading and, finally,
in the sphere of customs policy, the creation of a kind of free
port.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
In 1901, the company acquired a concession for the Baghdad
railway Konya-Baghdad-Bazra-Gulf of Persia (1,500 miles)
which connects with the Anatolian line by the Konya-Aregli-Bulgurlu
line. For taking up this concession, a new limited company
was founded which placed the order of constructing the
line, at first to Bulgurlu, with a Building Company registered in
Frankfort-on-the-Main.</p>

<p>Between 1893 and 1910, the Turkish government gave additional
grants&mdash;£1,948,000 for the Ada-Bazar-Angora line and
1,800,000 Turkish pounds for the Eskisehir-Konya line&mdash;a total
of £3,632,000.<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>  Finally, by the concession of 1907, the company
was empowered to drain the Karavirar Lake and to irrigate the
Konya plain, these works to be executed within six years at
government expense. In this instance, the company advanced
the government the necessary capital up to £780,000 at 5 per
cent interest, repayable within thirty-six years. In return the
Turkish government pledged as securities: (1) an annual sum
of 25,000 Turkish pounds, payable from the surplus of the tithes&#8217;
fund assigned to the <i>Administration de la Dette Publique Ottomane</i>
to cover the railway grants and other obligations; (2) the
residual tithes over the last 5 years in the newly irrigated
regions; (3) the net proceeds from the working of the irrigation
systems, and (4) the price of all reclaimed or irrigated land that
was sold. For the execution of this work, the Frankfort company
had formed a subsidiary company &#8216;for the irrigation of the
Konya plain&#8217; with a capital of £m. 5·4 to take this work in hand.</p>

<p>In 1908 the company obtained the concession for extending
the Konya railway as far as Baghdad and the Gulf of Persia,
again with inclusion of a guaranteed revenue.</p>

<p>To pay for this railway grant, a German Baghdad railway
loan was taken up in three instalments of £m. 2·16, £m. 4·32
and £m. 4·76 respectively, on the security of the aggregate
tithes for the <i>vilayets</i> Aydin, Baghdad, Mossul, Diarbekir, Ursa
and Aleppo, and the sheep-tax in the <i>vilayets</i> Konya, Adana,
Aleppo, etc.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<p>The foundation of accumulation here becomes quite clear.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
German capital builds railways, ports and irrigation works in
Asiatic Turkey; in all these enterprises it extorts new surplus
value from the Asiatics whom it employs as labour power. But
this surplus value must be realised together with the means of
production from Germany (railway materials, machinery, etc.).
How is it done? In part by commodity exchange which is
brought about by the railways, the dockyards, etc., and nurtured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
in Asia Minor under conditions of natural economy. In part,
i.e. in so far as commodity exchange does not grow quickly
enough for the needs of capital, by using force, the machinery
of the state, to convert the national real income into commodities;
these are turned into cash in order to realise capital plus
surplus value. That is the true object of the revenue grants for
independent enterprises run by foreign capital, and of the collateral
in the case of loans. In both instances so-called tithes
(<i>ueshur</i>), pledged in different ways, are paid in kind by the
Turkish peasant and these were gradually increased from about
12 to <span class="fraction" title="12 and 1 half">12<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></span> per cent. The peasant in the Asiatic <i>vilayet</i> must pay
up or else his tithe would simply be confiscated by the police and
the central and local authorities. These tithes, themselves a
manifestation of ancient Asiatic despotism based on natural
economy, are not collected by the Turkish government direct,
but by tax-farmers not unlike the tax-collectors of the <i>ancien
régime</i>; that is to say the expected returns from the levy in each
<i>vilayet</i> are separately auctioned by the state to tax-farmers. They
are bought by individual speculators or syndicates who sell the
tithes of each <i>sandshak</i> (district) to other speculators and these
resell their shares to a whole number of smaller agents. All these
middlemen want to cover their expenses and make the greatest
possible profit, and thus, by the time they are actually collected,
the peasants&#8217; contributions have swollen to enormous dimensions.
The tax-farmer will try to recoup himself for any mistake
in his calculations at the expense of the peasant, and the latter,
nearly always in debt, is impatient for the moment when he can
sell his harvest. But often, after cutting his corn, he cannot start
threshing for weeks, until indeed the tax-farmer deigns to take
his due. His entire harvest is about to rot in the fields, and the
tax-farmer, usually a grain merchant himself, takes advantage
of this fact and compels him to sell at a low price. These tax-collectors
know how to enlist the support of the officials, especially
the Muktars, the local headmen, against complaining
malcontents.<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<p>Along with the taxes on salt, tobacco, spirits, the excise on
silk, the fishing dues, etc., the tithes are pledged with the <i>Conseil
de l&#8217;Administration de la Dette Publique Ottomane</i> to serve as security
for the railway grant and the loans. In every case the <i>Conseil</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
reserves to itself the right to vet the tax-farmers&#8217; contracts and
stipulates for the proceeds of the tithe to be paid directly into
the coffers of its regional offices. If no tax-farmer can be found,
the tithes are stored in kind by the Turkish government; the
warehouse keys are deposited with the <i>Conseil</i> which then can
sell the tithes on its own account.</p>

<p>Thus the economic metabolism between the peasants of Asia
Minor, Syria and Mesopotamia on the one hand and German
capital on the other proceeds in the following way: in the
<i>vilayets</i> Konya, Baghdad, Bazra, etc., the grain comes into being
as a simple use-product of primitive peasant economy. It immediately
falls to the tithe-farmer as a state levy. Only then, in
the hands of this latter, does it become a commodity, and, as
such, money which falls to the state. This money is nothing but
converted peasant grain; it was not even produced as a commodity.
But now, as a state guarantee, it serves towards paying
for the construction and operation of railways, i.e. to realise
both the value of the means of production and the surplus value
extorted from the Asiatic peasants and proletariat in the building
and running of the railway. In this process further means of
production of German origin are used, and so the peasant grain
of Asia, converted into money, also serves to turn into cash the
surplus value that has been extorted from the German workers.
In the performance of these functions, the money rolls from the
hands of the Turkish government into the coffers of the <i>Deutsche
Bank</i>, and here it accumulates, as capitalist surplus value, in
the form of promoters&#8217; profits, royalties, dividends and interests
in the accounts of Messrs. Gwinner, Siemens, Stinnes and their
fellow directors, of the shareholders and clients of the <i>Deutsche
Bank</i> and the whole intricate system of its subsidiary companies.
If there is no tax-farmer, as provided in the concessions, then
the complicated metamorphoses are reduced to their most
simple and obvious terms: the peasant grain passes immediately
to the <i>Administration de la Dette Publique Ottomane</i>, i.e. to the
representatives of European capital, and becomes already in its
natural form a revenue for German and other foreign capital:
it realises capitalist surplus value even before it has shed its use-form
for the Asiatic peasant, even before it has become a commodity
and its own value has been realised. This is a coarse and
straightforward metabolism between European capital and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
Asiatic peasant economy, with the Turkish state reduced to its
real rôle, that of a political machinery for exploiting peasant
economy for capitalist purposes,&mdash;the real function, this, of all
Oriental states in the period of capitalist imperialism. This business
of paying for German goods with German capital in Asia
is not the absurd circle it seems at first, with the kind Germans
allowing the shrewd Turks merely the &#8216;use&#8217; of their great works
of civilisation&mdash;it is at bottom an exchange between German
capital and Asiatic peasant economy, an exchange performed
under state compulsion. On the one hand it makes for progressive
accumulation and expanding &#8216;spheres of interest&#8217; as a pretext
for further political and economic expansion of German
capital in Turkey. Railroad building and commodity exchange,
on the other hand, are fostered by the state on the basis of a
rapid disintegration, ruin and exploitation of Asiatic peasant
economy in the course of which the Turkish state becomes more
and more dependent on European capital, politically as well as
financially.<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

ACCUMULATION</h2>

<p>Imperialism is the political expression of the accumulation
of capital in its competitive struggle for what remains still
open of the non-capitalist environment. Still the largest part
of the world in terms of geography, this remaining field for the
expansion of capital is yet insignificant as against the high level
of development already attained by the productive forces of
capital; witness the immense masses of capital accumulated in
the old countries which seek an outlet for their surplus product
and strive to capitalise their surplus value, and the rapid
change-over to capitalism of the pre-capitalist civilisations. On
the international stage, then, capital must take appropriate
measures. With the high development of the capitalist countries
and their increasingly severe competition in acquiring non-capitalist
areas, imperialism grows in lawlessness and violence,
both in aggression against the non-capitalist world and in ever
more serious conflicts among the competing capitalist countries.
But the more violently, ruthlessly and thoroughly imperialism
brings about the decline of non-capitalist civilisations, the more
rapidly it cuts the very ground from under the feet of capitalist
accumulation. Though imperialism is the historical method for
prolonging the career of capitalism, it is also a sure means of
bringing it to a swift conclusion. This is not to say that capitalist
development must be actually driven to this extreme: the mere
tendency towards imperialism of itself takes forms which make
the final phase of capitalism a period of catastrophe.</p>

<p>Classical economics, in its period of storm and stress, had had
high hopes of a peaceful development of the accumulation of
capital and of a trade and industry which can only prosper in
times of peace, evolving the orthodox Manchester ideology of
the harmony of interests among the world&#8217;s commercial nations
on the one hand, and between capital and labour on the other.
These hopes were apparently justified in Europe by the short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
period of Free Trade in the sixties and seventies, which was based
upon the mistaken doctrine of the English Free Traders that the
only theoretical and practical condition for the accumulation of
capital is commodity exchange, that the two are identical. As
we have seen, Ricardo and his whole school identified accumulation
and its reproductive conditions with simple commodity
production and the conditions of simple commodity circulation.
This was soon to become even more obvious in the practices of
the common Free Trader. The special interests of the exporting
Lancashire cotton manufacturers in Manchester determined the
entire line of argument of the Cobden League. Their principal
object was to get markets, and it became an article of faith:
&#8216;Buy from foreign countries and thus in turn sell our industrial
product, our cotton goods, on the new markets.&#8217; Cobden and
Bright demanded Free Trade and cheaper foodstuffs in particular
in the interest of consumption; but the consumer was not the
worker who eats the bread, but the capitalist who consumes
labour power.</p>

<p>This teaching never expressed the interests of capitalist
accumulation as a whole. In England herself it was given the
lie already in the forties, when the harmony of interests of the
commercial nations in the East were proclaimed to the sound of
gunfire in the Opium Wars which ultimately, by the annexation
of Hongkong, brought about the very opposite of such harmony,
a system of &#8216;spheres of interest&#8217;.<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>  On the European Continent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
Free Trade in the sixties did not represent the interests of industrial
capital, because the foremost Free Trade countries of the
Continent were still predominantly agrarian with a comparatively
feeble development of industry. Rather, the policy of Free
Trade was implemented as a means for the political reconstruction
of the Central European states. In Germany, under Bismarck
and Manteuffel, it was a peculiarly Prussian lever for
ousting Austria from the <i>Bund</i> and the <i>Zollverein</i> and to set up the
new German Empire under Prussian leadership. Economically
speaking, the mainstays of Free Trade were in this case the
interests both of commercial capital, especially in the Hansa
towns to whom international trade was vital, and of agrarian
consumers; among industry proper, it was otherwise. The iron
industry was won over only with difficulty and in exchange for
the abolition of the Rhine tolls. But the cotton industry in
Southern Germany remained irreconcilable and clung to protective
tariffs. In France, &#8216;most favoured nations&#8217; clause&#8217; agreements,
the basis of the Free Trade system all over Europe, were
concluded by Napoleon III without the consent, and even
against the will, of parliament, industrialists and agrarians, who
constituted an absolute majority, being in favour of protective
tariffs. The government of the Second Empire only took the
course of commercial treaties as an emergency measure&mdash;Britain
accepted it as such&mdash;in order to get round political opposition in
France and to establish Free Trade behind the back of the legislature
by international action. The first principal treaty between
England and France simply rode rough-shod over public opinion
in France.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>  Two imperial decrees abolished the old system of
French protective tariffs which had been in force from 1853 to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
1862. With scant observance of the formalities they were &#8216;ratified&#8217;
in 1863. In Italy, Free Trade was a prop of Cavour&#8217;s policy,
depending as it did on French support. Under pressure of
public opinion, an inquiry was made in 1870 which revealed
that those most intimately concerned were hostile to the policy of
Free Trade. In Russia, finally, the tendency towards Free Trade
in the sixties was but the first step towards creating a broad
basis for commodity economy and industry on a large scale,
coming at the same time as the abolition of serfdom and the
construction of a railway network.<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>Thus the very inception of an international system of Free
Trade shows it to be just a passing phase in the history of
capitalist accumulation, and it shows up the fallacy of attributing
the general reversion to protective tariffs after the seventies
simply to a defensive reaction against English Free Trade.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
Such an explanation is vitiated by the fact that both in
Germany and France the leaders in the reversion to protective
tariffs were the agrarian interests, that the measures were
directed not against British but against American competition,
and that not England but Germany constituted the chief
danger to the rising home industry in Russia, and France to
that in Italy. Nor was Britain&#8217;s monopoly the cause for the
world-wide depression which prevailed since the seventies and
induced the desire for protective tariffs. We must look deeper
for the reasons responsible for the change of front on the question
of protective tariffs. The doctrine of Free Trade with its
delusion about the harmony of interests on the world market
corresponded with an outlook which conceived of everything
in terms of commodity exchange. It was abandoned just as soon
as big industrial capital had become sufficiently established in
the principal countries of the European Continent to look to
the conditions for its accumulation. As against the mutual
interests of capitalist countries, these latter bring to the fore
the antagonism engendered by the competitive struggle for the
non-capitalist environment.</p>

<p>When the Free Trade era opened, Eastern Asia was only just
being made accessible by the Chinese wars, and European
capital had but begun to make headway in Egypt. In the
eighties the policy of expansion became ever stronger, together
with a policy of protective tariffs. There was an uninterrupted
succession of events during the eighties: the British occupation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
of Egypt, Germany&#8217;s colonial conquests in Africa, the French
occupation of Tunisia together with the Tonkin expedition,
Italy&#8217;s advances in Assab and Massawa, the Abyssinian war
and the creation of a separate Eritrea, and the English conquests
in South Africa. The clash between Italy and France
over the Tunisian sphere of interest was the characteristic prelude
to the Franco-Italian tariff war seven years later, by which
drastic epilogue an end was made to the Free Trade harmony of
interests on the European Continent. To monopolise the non-capitalist
areas at home and abroad became the war-cry of
capital, while the free-trade policy of the &#8216;open door&#8217; specifically
represented the peculiar helplessness of non-capitalist countries
in the face of international capital and the natural equilibrium
which was aimed at by its competition in the preliminary stage
of the partial or total occupation of these areas as colonies or
spheres of interest. As the oldest capitalist Empire, England
alone could so far remain loyal to Free Trade, primarily because
she had long had immense possessions of non-capitalist areas
as a basis for operations which afforded her almost unlimited
opportunities for capitalist accumulation. Until recently, she
had thus in fact been beyond the competition of other capitalist
countries. These, in turn, universally strove to become self-sufficient
behind a barrier of protective tariffs; yet they buy one
another&#8217;s commodities and come to depend ever more one upon
another for replenishing their material conditions of reproduction.
Indeed, protective tariffs have by now completely lost their
use for technical development of the productive forces, all too
often being the instrument for the artificial conservation of
obsolete productive methods. The inherent contradictions of an
international policy of protective tariffs, exactly like the dual
character of the international loan system, are just a reflection
of the historical antagonism which has developed between the
dual interests of accumulation: expansion, the realisation and
capitalisation of surplus value on the one hand, and, on the
other, an outlook which conceives of everything purely in terms
of commodity exchange.</p>

<p>This fact is evidenced particularly in that the modern system
of high protective tariffs, required by colonial expansion and
the increasing inner tension of the capitalist medium, was also
instituted with a view to increasing armaments. The reversion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
to protective tariffs was carried through in Germany as well as
in France, Italy, and Russia, together with, and in the interests
of, an expansion of the armed services, as the basis for the
European competition in armaments which was developing at
that time, first on land, and then also at sea. European Free
Trade, with its attendant continental system of infantry, had
been superseded by protective tariffs as the foundation and
supplement of an imperialist system with a strong bias towards
naval power.</p>

<p>Thus capitalist accumulation as a whole, as an actual historical
process, has two different aspects. One concerns the
commodity market and the place where surplus value is produced&mdash;the
factory, the mine, the agricultural estate. Regarded
in this light, accumulation is a purely economic process, with its
most important phase a transaction between the capitalist and
wage labourer. In both its phases, however, it is confined to
the exchange of equivalents and remains within the limits of
commodity exchange. Here, in form at any rate, peace, property
and equality prevail, and the keen dialectics of scientific analysis
were required to reveal how the right of ownership changes in
the course of accumulation into appropriation of other people&#8217;s
property, how commodity exchange turns into exploitation and
equality becomes class-rule.</p>

<p>The other aspect of the accumulation of capital concerns the
relations between capitalism and the non-capitalist modes of
production which start making their appearance on the international
stage. Its predominant methods are colonial policy,
an international loan system&mdash;a policy of spheres of interest&mdash;and
war. Force, fraud, oppression, looting are openly displayed
without any attempt at concealment, and it requires an effort
to discover within this tangle of political violence and contests
of power the stern laws of the economic process.</p>

<p>Bourgeois liberal theory takes into account only the former
aspect: the realm of &#8216;peaceful competition&#8217;, the marvels of
technology and pure commodity exchange; it separates it
strictly from the other aspect: the realm of capital&#8217;s blustering
violence which is regarded as more or less incidental to foreign
policy and quite independent of the economic sphere of capital.</p>

<p>In reality, political power is nothing but a vehicle for the
economic process. The conditions for the reproduction of capital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
provide the organic link between these two aspects of the
accumulation of capital. The historical career of capitalism can
only be appreciated by taking them together. &#8216;Sweating blood
and filth with every pore from head to toe&#8217; characterises not
only the birth of capital but also its progress in the world at
every step, and thus capitalism prepares its own downfall under
ever more violent contortions and convulsions.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XXXII</i></h2>

<h2>MILITARISM AS A PROVINCE
OF ACCUMULATION</h2>

<p>Militarism fulfils a quite definite function in the history
of capital, accompanying as it does every historical
phase of accumulation. It plays a decisive part in the
first stages of European capitalism, in the period of the so-called
&#8216;primitive accumulation&#8217;, as a means of conquering the New
World and the spice-producing countries of India. Later, it is
employed to subject the modern colonies, to destroy the social
organisations of primitive societies so that their means of production
may be appropriated, forcibly to introduce commodity
trade in countries where the social structure had been unfavourable
to it, and to turn the natives into a proletariat by compelling
them to work for wages in the colonies. It is responsible for
the creation and expansion of spheres of interest for European
capital in non-European regions, for extorting railway concessions
in backward countries, and for enforcing the claims of
European capital as international lender. Finally, militarism is
a weapon in the competitive struggle between capitalist countries
for areas of non-capitalist civilisation.</p>

<p>In addition, militarism has yet another important function.
From the purely economic point of view, it is a pre-eminent
means for the realisation of surplus value; it is in itself a province
of accumulation. In examining the question who should
count as a buyer for the mass of products containing the capitalised
surplus value, we have again and again refused to consider
the state and its organs as consumers. Since their income
is derivative, they were all taken to belong to the special category
of those who live on the surplus value (or partly on the
wage of labour), together with the liberal professions and the
various parasites of present-day society (&#8216;king, professor, prostitute,
mercenary&#8217;). But this interpretation will only do on two
assumptions: first, if we take it, in accordance with Marx&#8217;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
diagram, that the state has no other sources of taxation than
capitalist surplus value and wages,<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>  and secondly, if we regard
the state and its organs as consumers pure and simple. If the
issue turns on the personal consumption of the state organs (as
also of the &#8216;mercenary&#8217;) the point is that consumption is partly
transferred from the working class to the hangers-on of the
capitalist class, in so far as the workers foot the bill.</p>

<p>Let us assume for a moment that the indirect taxes extorted
from the workers, which mean a curtailment of their consumption,
are used entirely to pay the salaries of the state officials and
to provision the regular army. There will then be no change in
the reproduction of social capital as a whole. Both Departments
II and I remain constant because society as a whole still
demands the same kind of products and in the same quantities.
Only <i>v</i> as the commodity of &#8216;labour power&#8217; has changed in value
in relation to the products of Department II, i.e. in relation to
the means of subsistence. This <i>v</i>, the same amount of money
representing labour power, is now exchanged for a smaller
amount of means of subsistence. What happens to the products
of Department II which are then left over? Instead of the
workers, the state officials and the regular army now receive
them. The organs of the capitalist state take over the workers&#8217;
consumption on the same scale exactly. Although the conditions
of reproduction have remained stable, there has been a
redistribution of the total product. Part of the products of
Department II, originally intended entirely for the consumption
of the workers as equivalent for <i>v</i>, is now allocated to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
hangers-on of the capitalist class for consumption. From the
point of view of social reproduction, it is as if the relative surplus
value had in the first place been larger by a certain amount
which is added on to the consumption of the capitalist class and
its hangers-on.</p>

<p>So far the crude exploitation, by the mechanism of indirect
taxation, of the working class for the support of the capitalist
state&#8217;s officials amounts merely to an increase of the surplus
value, of that part of it, that is to say, which is consumed. The
difference is that this further splitting off of surplus value from
variable capital only comes later, after the exchange between
capital and labour has been accomplished. But the consumption
by the organs of the capitalist state has no bearing on the
realisation of <i>capitalised</i> surplus value, because the additional
surplus value for this consumption&mdash;even though it comes about
at the workers&#8217; expense&mdash;is created afterwards. On the other
hand, if the workers did not pay for the greater part of the state
officials&#8217; upkeep, the capitalists themselves would have to bear
the entire cost of it. A corresponding portion of their surplus
value would have to be assigned directly to keeping the organs
of their class-rule, either at the expense of production which
would have to be curtailed accordingly, or, which is more probable,
it would come from the surplus value intended for their
consumption. The capitalists would have to capitalise on a
smaller scale because of having to contribute more towards the
immediate preservation of their own class. In so far as they shift
onto the working class (and also the representatives of simple
commodity production, such as peasants and artisans) the principal
charge of their hangers-on, the capitalists have a larger
portion of surplus value available for capitalisation. But as yet
<i>no opportunities for such capitalisation</i> have come into being, no new
market, that is to say, for the surplus value that has become
available, in which it could produce and realise new commodities.
But when the monies concentrated in the exchequer by
taxation are used for the production of armaments, the picture
is changed.</p>

<p>With indirect taxation and high protective tariffs, the bill
of militarism is footed mainly by the working class and the
peasants. The two kinds of taxation must be considered separately.
From an economic point of view, it amounts to the following,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
as far as the working class is concerned: provided that
wages are not raised to make up for the higher price of foodstuffs&mdash;which
is at present the fate of the greatest part of the working
class, including even the minority that is organised in trade
unions, owing to the pressure of cartels and employers&#8217; organisations<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> &mdash;indirect
taxation means that part of the purchasing
power of the working class is transferred to the state. Now as
before the variable capital, as a fixed amount of money, will put
in motion an appropriate quantity of living labour, that is to
say it serves to employ the appropriate quantity of constant
capital in production and to produce the corresponding amount
of surplus value. As soon as capital has completed this cycle, it
is divided between the working class and the state: the workers
surrender the state part of the money they received as wages.
Capital has wholly appropriated the former variable capital in
its material form, as labour power, but the working class retains
only part of the variable capital in the form of money, the state
claiming the rest. And this invariably happens after capital has
run its cycle between capitalist and worker; it takes place, as it
were, behind the back of capital, at no point impinging direct
on the vital stages of the circulation of capital and the production
of surplus value, so that it is no immediate concern of the
latter. But all the same it does affect the conditions for the reproduction
of capital as a whole. The transfer of some of the purchasing
power from the working class to the state entails a
proportionate decrease in the consumption of means of subsistence
by the working class. For capital as a whole, it means
producing a smaller quantity of consumer goods for the working
class, provided that both variable capital (in the form of money
and as labour power) and the mass of appropriated surplus
value remain constant, so that the workers get a smaller share
of the aggregate product. In the process of reproduction of the
entire capital, then, means of subsistence will be produced in
amounts smaller than the value of the variable capital, because
of the shift in the ratio between the value of the variable capital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
and the quantity of means of subsistence in which it is realised,
with the money wages of labour remaining constant, according
to our premise, or at any rate not rising sufficiently to offset the
increase in the price of foodstuffs. This increase represents the
level of indirect taxation.</p>

<p>How will the material relations of reproduction be adjusted?
When fewer means of subsistence are needed for the renewal of
labour power, a corresponding amount of constant capital and
living labour becomes available which can now be used for producing
other commodities in response to a new effective demand
arising within society. It arises from the side of the state which
has appropriated, by way of tax legislation, the part wanting of
the workers&#8217; purchasing power. This time, however, the state
does not demand means of subsistence (after all that has already
been said under the heading of &#8216;third persons&#8217;, we shall here
ignore the demand for means of subsistence for state officials
which is also satisfied out of taxes) but it requires a special kind
of product, namely the militarist weapons of war on land and
at sea.</p>

<p>Again we take Marx&#8217;s second diagram of accumulation
as the basis for investigating the ensuing changes in social
reproduction:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="25">
<tr><td align="right">I.</td><td align="right">5,000<i>c</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,000<i>v</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,000<i>s</i></td><td align="right">=</td><td align="right">7,000</td><td align="left">means of production</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">II.</td><td align="right">1,430<i>c</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">285<i>v</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">285<i>s</i></td><td align="right">=</td><td align="right">2,000</td><td align="left">means of subsistence</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Now let us suppose that, owing to indirect taxation and the
consequent increase in the price of means of subsistence, the
working class as a whole reduces consumption by, say, a 100
value units of the real wages. As before, the workers receive
1,000<i>v</i>&nbsp;+ 285<i>v</i>&nbsp;= 1,285<i>v</i> in money, but for this money they only get
means of subsistence to the value of 1185. The 100 units which
represent the tax increase in the price of foodstuffs go to the
state which receives in addition military taxes from the peasants,
etc., to the value of 150 units, bringing the total up to 250. This
total constitutes a new demand&mdash;the demand for armaments.
At present, however, we are only interested in the 100 units
taken from the workers&#8217; wages. This demand for armaments to
the value of 100 must be satisfied by the creation of an appropriate
branch of production which requires a constant capital of
71·5 and a variable capital of 14·25, assuming the average
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
organic composition outlined in Marx&#8217;s diagram.</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="26">
<tr><td align="center">71·5<i>c</i></td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">14·25<i>v</i></td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">14·25<i>s</i></td><td align="center">=</td><td align="center">100</td><td align="center">weapons of war</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This new branch of production further requires that 71·5
means of production be produced and about 13 means of subsistence,
because, of course, the real wages of the workers are
also less by about one-thirteenth.</p>

<p>You could counter by saying that the profit accruing to
capital from this new expansion of demand is merely on paper,
because the cut in the actual consumption of the working class
will inevitably result in a corresponding curtailment of the
means of subsistence produced. It will take the following form
for Department II:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="27">
<tr><td align="center">71·5<i>c</i></td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">14·25<i>v</i></td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">14·25<i>s</i></td><td align="center">=</td><td align="center">100</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In addition, Department I will also have to contract accordingly,
so that, owing to the decreasing consumption of the working
class, the equations for both departments will be:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="28">
<tr><td align="right">I.</td><td align="left">4,949<i>c</i></td><td align="left">+</td><td align="left">989·75<i>v</i></td><td align="left">+</td><td align="left">989·75<i>s</i></td><td align="left">=</td><td align="left">6,928·5</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">II.</td><td align="left">1,358·5<i>c</i></td><td align="left">+</td><td align="left">270·75<i>v</i></td><td align="left">+</td><td align="left">270·75<i>s</i></td><td align="left">=</td><td align="left">1,900</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>If, by the mediation of the state, the same 100 units now call
forth armament production of an equal volume with a corresponding
fillip to the production of producer goods, this is at
first sight only an extraneous change in the material forms of
social production: instead of a quantity of means of subsistence a
quantity of armaments is now being produced. Capital has won
with the left hand only what it has lost with the right. Or we
might say that the large number of capitalists producing means
of subsistence have lost the effective demand in favour of a small
group of big armament manufacturers.</p>

<p>But this picture is only valid for individual capital. Here it
makes no difference indeed whether production engages in one
sphere of activity or another. As far as the individual capitalist
is concerned, there are no departments of total production such
as the diagram distinguishes. There are only commodities and
buyers, and it is completely immaterial to him whether he produces
instruments of life or instruments of death, corned beef or
armour plating.</p>

<p>Opponents of militarism frequently appeal to this point of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
view to show that military supplies as an economic investment
for capital merely put profit taken from one capitalist into the
pocket of another.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>  On the other hand, capital and its advocates
try to overpersuade the working class to this point of view
by talking them into the belief that indirect taxes and the
demand of the state would only bring about a change in the
material form of reproduction; instead of other commodities
cruisers and guns would be produced which would give the
workers as good a living, if not a better one.</p>

<p>One glance at the diagram shows how little truth there is in
this argument as far as the workers are concerned. To make
comparison easier, we will suppose the armament factories to
employ just as many workers as were employed before in the
production of means of subsistence for the working class. 1,285
units will then be paid out as wages, but now they will only
buy 1,185&#8217;s worth of means of subsistence.</p>

<p>All this looks different from the perspective of capital as a
whole. For this the 100 at the disposal of the state, which represent
the demand for armaments, constitute a new market.
Originally this money was variable capital and as such it has
done its job, it has been exchanged for living labour which produced
the surplus value. But then the circulation of the variable
capital was stopped short, this money was split off, and it now
appears as a new purchasing power in the possession of the
state. It has been created by sleight of hand, as it were, but still
it has the same effects as a newly opened market. Of course for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
the time being capital is debarred from selling 100 units of consumer
goods for the working class, and the individual capitalist
considers the worker just as good a consumer and buyer of commodities
as anyone else, another capitalist, the state, the peasant,
foreign countries, etc. But let us not forget that for capital as a
whole the upkeep of the working class is only a necessary evil,
only a means towards the real end of production: the creation
and realisation of surplus value. If it were possible to extort
surplus value without giving labour an equal measure of means
of subsistence, it would be all the better for business. To begin
with indirect taxation has the same effects as if&mdash;the price of
foodstuffs remaining constant&mdash;the capitalists had succeeded in
depressing wages by a hundred units without detracting from
the work performed, seeing that a lower output of consumer
goods is equally the inevitable result of continuous wage cuts. If
wages are cut heavily, capital does not worry about having to
produce fewer means of subsistence for the workers, in fact it
delights in this practice at every opportunity; similarly, capital
as a whole does not mind if the effective demand of the working
class for means of subsistence is curtailed because of indirect
taxation which is not compensated by a rise in wages. This may
seem strange because in the latter case the balance of the variable
capital goes to the exchequer, while with a direct wage cut
it remains in the capitalists&#8217; pockets and&mdash;commodity prices
remaining equal&mdash;increases the relative surplus value. But a
continuous and universal reduction of money wages can only
be carried through on rare occasions, especially if trade union
organisation is highly developed. There are strong social and
political barriers to this fond aspiration of capital. Depression of
the real wage by means of indirect taxation, on the other hand,
can be carried through promptly, smoothly and universally, and
it usually takes time for protests to be heard; and besides, the
opposition is confined to the political field and has no immediate
economic repercussions. The subsequent restriction in the
production of means of subsistence does not represent a loss of
markets for capital as a whole but rather a saving in the costs
of producing surplus value. Surplus value is never realised by
producing means of subsistence for the workers&mdash;however necessary
this may be, as the reproduction of living labour, for the
production of surplus value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
But to come back to our example:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="29">
<tr><td align="right">I.</td><td align="right">5,000<i>c</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,000<i>v</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,000<i>s</i></td><td align="right">=</td><td align="right">7,000</td><td align="left">means of production</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">II.</td><td align="right">1,430<i>c</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">285<i>v</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">285<i>v</i></td><td align="right">=</td><td align="right">2,000</td><td align="left">means of subsistence</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>At first it looks as if Department II were also creating and
realising surplus value in the process of producing means of subsistence
for the workers, and Department I by producing the
requisite means of production. But if we take the social product
as a whole, the illusion disappears. The equation is in that case:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="30">
<tr><td align="right">6,430<i>c</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,285<i>v</i></td><td align="right">+</td><td align="right">1,285<i>s</i></td><td align="right">=</td><td align="right">9,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Now, if the means of subsistence for the workers are cut by
100 units, the corresponding contraction of both departments
will give us the following equations:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="31">
<tr><td align="right">I.</td><td align="left">4,949<i>c</i></td><td align="left">+</td><td align="left">989·75<i>v</i></td><td align="left">+</td><td align="left">989·75<i>s</i></td><td align="left">=</td><td align="left">6,928·5</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">II.</td><td align="left">1,358·5<i>c</i></td><td align="left">+</td><td align="left">270·75<i>v</i></td><td align="left">+</td><td align="left">270·75<i>s</i></td><td align="left">=</td><td align="left">1,900</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>and for the social product as a whole:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="32">
<tr><td align="left">6,307·5<i>c</i> + 1,260·5<i>v</i> + 1,260·5<i>s</i> = 8,828·5</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This looks like a general decrease in both the total volume of
production and in the production of surplus value&mdash;but only if
we contemplate just the abstract quantities of value in the composition
of the total product; it does not hold good for the
material composition thereof. Looking closer, we find that nothing
but the upkeep of labour is in effect decreased. Fewer means
of subsistence and production are now being made, no doubt,
but then, they had had no other function save to maintain
workers. The social product is smaller and less capital is now
employed&mdash;but then, the object of capitalist production is not
simply to employ as much capital as possible, but to produce as
much surplus value as possible. Capital has only decreased
because a smaller amount is sufficient for maintaining the
workers. If the total cost of maintaining the workers employed
in the society came to 1,285 units in the first instance, the
present decrease of the social product by 171·5&mdash;the difference of
(9,000-8,828·5)&mdash;comes off this maintenance charge, and there
is a consequent change in the composition of the social product:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="33">
<tr><td align="left">6,430<i>c</i> + 1,113·5<i>v</i> + 1,285<i>s</i> = 8,828·5</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
Constant capital and surplus value remain unchanged, and
only the variable capital, paid labour, has diminished. Or&mdash;in
case there are doubts about constant capital being unaffected&mdash;we
may further allow for the event that, as would happen in
actual practice, concomitant with the decrease in means of subsistence
for the workers there will be a corresponding cut in
the constant capital. The equation for the social product as a
whole would then be:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="34">
<tr><td align="left">6,307·5<i>c</i> + 1,236<i>v</i> + 1,285<i>s</i> = 8,828·5</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In spite of the smaller social product, there is no change in
the surplus value in either case, and it is only the cost of maintaining
the workers that has fallen.</p>

<p>Put it this way: the value of the aggregate social product may
be defined as consisting of three parts, the total constant capital
of the society, its total variable capital, and its total surplus
value, of which the first set of products contains no additional
labour, and the second and third no means of production. As
regards their material form, all these products come into being
in the given period of production&mdash;though in point of value the
constant capital had been produced in a previous period and is
merely being transferred to new products. On this basis, we can
also divide all the workers employed into three mutually exclusive
categories: those who produce the aggregate constant
capital of the society, those who provide the upkeep for all the
workers, and finally those who create the entire surplus value for
the capitalist class.</p>

<p>If, then, the workers&#8217; consumption is curtailed, only workers
in the second category will lose their jobs. <i>Ex hypothesi</i>, these
workers had never created surplus value for capital, and in consequence
their dismissal is therefore no loss from the capitalist&#8217;s
point of view but a gain, since it decreases the cost of producing
surplus value.</p>

<p>The demand of the state which arises at the same time has the
lure of a new and attractive sphere for realising the surplus
value. Some of the money circulating as variable capital breaks
free of this cycle and in the state treasury it represents a new
demand. For the technique of taxation, of course, the order of
events is rather different, since the amount of the indirect taxes
is actually advanced to the state by capital and is merely being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
refunded to the capitalists by the sale of their commodities, as
part of their price. But economically speaking, it makes no difference.
The crucial point is that the quantity of money with the
function of variable capital should first mediate the exchange
between capital and labour power. Later, when there is an exchange
between workers and capitalists as buyers and sellers of
commodities respectively, this money will change hands and
accrue to the state as taxes. This money, which capital has set
circulating, first fulfils its primary function in the exchange with
labour power, but subsequently, by mediation of the state, it
begins an entirely new career. As a new purchasing power, belonging
with neither labour nor capital, it becomes interested in
new products, in a special branch of production which does not
cater for either the capitalists or the working class, and thus it
offers capital new opportunities for creating and realising surplus
value. When we were formerly taking it for granted that
the indirect taxes extorted from the workers are used for paying
the officials and for provisioning the army, we found the &#8216;saving&#8217;
in the consumption of the working class to mean that the
workers rather than the capitalists were made to pay for the
personal consumption of the hangers-on of the capitalist class
and the tools of their class-rule. This charge devolved from the
surplus value to the variable capital, and a corresponding
amount of the surplus value became available for purposes of
capitalisation. Now we see how the taxes extorted from the
workers afford capital a new opportunity for accumulation
when they are used for armament manufacture.</p>

<p>On the basis of indirect taxation, militarism in practice works
both ways. By lowering the normal standard of living for the
working class, it ensures both that capital should be able to
maintain a regular army, the organ of capitalist rule, and that
it may tap an impressive field for further accumulation.<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>We have still to examine the second source of the state&#8217;s purchasing
power referred to in our example, the 150 units out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
the total 250 invested in armaments. They differ essentially
from the hundred units considered above in that they are not
supplied by the workers but by the petty bourgeoisie, i.e. the
artisans and peasants. (In this connection, we can ignore the
comparatively small tax-contribution of the capitalist class
itself.)</p>

<p>The money accruing to the state as taxes from the peasant
masses&mdash;as our generic term for all non-proletarian consumers&mdash;was
not originally advanced by capital and has not split off
from capital in circulation. In the hand of the peasant it is the
equivalent of goods that have been realised, the exchange value
of simple commodity production. The state now gets part of the
purchasing power of the non-capitalist consumers, purchasing
power, that is to say, which is already free to realise the surplus
value for capitalist accumulation. Now the question arises,
whether economic changes will result for capital, and if so, of
what nature, from diverting the purchasing power of such strata
to the state for militarist purposes. It almost looks as if we had
come up against yet another shift in the material form of reproduction.
Capital will now produce an equivalent of war materials
for the state instead of producing large quantities of means of
production and subsistence for peasant consumers. But in fact
the changes go deeper. First and foremost, the state can use the
mechanism of taxation to mobilise much larger amounts of purchasing
power from the non-capitalist consumers than they
would ordinarily spend on their own consumption.</p>

<p>Indeed the modern system of taxation itself is largely responsible
for forcing commodity economy on the peasants. Under
pressure of taxes, the peasant must turn more and more of
his produce into commodities, and at the same time he must
buy more and more. Taxation presses the produce of peasant
economy into circulation and compels the peasants to become
buyers of capitalist products. Finally, on a basis of commodity
production in the peasant style, the system of taxation lures
more purchasing power from peasant economy than would
otherwise become active.</p>

<p>What would normally have been hoarded by the peasants
and the lower middle classes until it has grown big enough to
invest in savings banks and other banks is now set free to constitute
an effective demand and an opportunity for investment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
Further the multitude of individual and insignificant demands
for a whole range of commodities, which will become effective
at different times and which might often be met just as well by
simple commodity production, is now replaced by a comprehensive
and homogeneous demand of the state. And the satisfaction
of this demand presupposes a big industry of the highest
order. It requires the most favourable conditions for the production
of surplus value and for accumulation. In the form of
government contracts for army supplies the scattered purchasing
power of the consumers is concentrated in large quantities
and, free of the vagaries and subjective fluctuations of
personal consumption, it achieves an almost automatic regularity
and rhythmic growth. Capital itself ultimately controls
this automatic and rhythmic movement of militarist production
through the legislature and a press whose function is to mould
so-called &#8216;public opinion&#8217;. That is why this particular province
of capitalist accumulation at first seems capable of infinite expansion.
All other attempts to expand markets and set up operational
bases for capital largely depend on historical, social and
political factors beyond the control of capital, whereas production
for militarism represents a province whose regular and progressive
expansion seems primarily determined by capital itself.</p>

<p>In this way capital turns historical necessity into a virtue: the
ever fiercer competition in the capitalist world itself provides a
field for accumulation of the first magnitude. Capital increasingly
employs militarism for implementing a foreign and
colonial policy to get hold of the means of production and
labour power of non-capitalist countries and societies. This same
militarism works in a like manner in the capitalist countries to
divert purchasing power away from the non-capitalist strata.
The representatives of simple commodity production and the
working class are affected alike in this way. At their expense,
the accumulation of capital is raised to the highest power, by
robbing the one of their productive forces and by depressing the
other&#8217;s standard of living. Needless to say, after a certain stage
the conditions for the accumulation of capital both at home and
abroad turn into their very opposite&mdash;they become conditions
for the decline of capitalism.</p>

<p>The more ruthlessly capital sets about the destruction of non-capitalist
strata at home and in the outside world, the more it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
lowers the standard of living for the workers as a whole, the
greater also is the change in the day-to-day history of capital.
It becomes a string of political and social disasters and convulsions,
and under these conditions, punctuated by periodical
economic catastrophes or crises, accumulation can go on no
longer.</p>

<p>But even before this natural economic impasse of capital&#8217;s
own creating is properly reached it becomes a necessity for the
international working class to revolt against the rule of capital.</p>

<p>Capitalism is the first mode of economy with the weapon of
propaganda, a mode which tends to engulf the entire globe and
to stamp out all other economies, tolerating no rival at its side.
Yet at the same time it is also the first mode of economy which
is unable to exist by itself, which needs other economic systems
as a medium and soil. Although it strives to become universal,
and, indeed, on account of this its tendency, it must break down&mdash;because
it is immanently incapable of becoming a universal
form of production. In its living history it is a contradiction in
itself, and its movement of accumulation provides a solution to
the conflict and aggravates it at the same time. At a certain
stage of development there will be no other way out than the
application of socialist principles. The aim of socialism is not
accumulation but the satisfaction of toiling humanity&#8217;s wants by
developing the productive forces of the entire globe. And so we
find that socialism is by its very nature an harmonious and
universal system of economy.</p>

is much higher in Department II than in I. Marx has made the rate of
exploitation equal in the two departments, and the ratio of constant to
variable capital higher in Department I. This is evidently an oversight.
The two departments must trade with each other at market prices, not in
terms of <i>value</i>. Therefore <i>s</i><sub>1</sub> must represent the profits accruing to Department
I, not a proportion (half in the example) of the <i>value</i> generated in

organic composition of capital in Department I. The point is interesting, as
it shows that when off guard Marx forgot that he could make prices proportional
to <i>values</i> only when the organic composition of capital is the same in

the freedom of commerce sustains the sale of products at a good price, ...

<p><a name="Footnote_68" id="Footnote_68" href="#FNanchor_68"><span class="label">[68]</span></a>Attention must be drawn to the fact that Mirabeau in his <i>Explications</i>
on the <i>Tableau Économique</i> explicitly mentions the fixed capital of the unproductive
class: &#8216;The primary advances of this class, for the establishment
of manufactures, for instruments, machines, mills, smithies (ironworks) and
other factories ... (amount to) 2,000 million livres&#8217; (<i>Tableau Économique
avec ses Explications</i>, 1760, p. 82). In his confusing sketch of the <i>Tableau</i>
itself, Mirabeau, too, fails to take this fixed capital of the sterile class into
account.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_69" id="Footnote_69" href="#FNanchor_69"><span class="label">[69]</span></a>Smith accordingly arrives at this general formulation: &#8216;The value which
the workmen add to the materials, therefore, resolves itself in this case into
two parts, of which the one pays their wages, the other the profits of their
employer upon the whole stock of materials and wages which he advanced&#8217;
(op. cit., vol. i, p. 83). Further, in Book II, chap. 8, on industrial labour in
particular: &#8216;The labour of a manufacturer adds generally to the value of the
materials which he works upon, that of his own maintenance and of his
master&#8217;s profit. The labour of a menial servant, on the contrary, adds to the
value of nothing. Though the manufacturer has his wages advanced to him
by his master, he in reality costs him no expense, the value of those wages
being generally restored, together with a profit, in the improved value of the
subject upon which his labour is bestowed&#8217; (op. cit., vol. ii, pp. 93-4).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_70" id="Footnote_70" href="#FNanchor_70"><span class="label">[70]</span></a>&#8216;The labourers ... therefore, employed in agriculture, not only
occasion, like the workmen in manufactures, the reproduction of a value
equal to their own consumption, or to the capital which employs them,
together with its owner&#8217;s profit, but of a much greater value. Over and
above the capital of the farmer and all its profits, they regularly occasion
the reproduction of the rent of the landlord&#8217; (ibid., p. 149).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_71" id="Footnote_71" href="#FNanchor_71"><span class="label">[71]</span></a>Ibid., pp. 97-8. Yet already in the following sentence Smith converts
capital completely into wages, that is variable capital: &#8216;That part of the
annual produce of the land and labour of any country which replaces a
capital, never is immediately employed to maintain any but productive
hands. It pays the wages of productive labour only. That which is immediately
destined for constituting a revenue, either as profit or as rent,
may maintain indifferently either productive or unproductive hands&#8217; (ibid.,

also runs through the work of Smith. According to that, the <i>price</i> of the commodity
cannot be resolved into <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>, though the <i>value</i> of commodities consists
in <i>v</i>&nbsp;+ <i>s</i>. This distinction, however, is more important with regard to
Smith&#8217;s theory of value than in the present context where we are mainly

against the mercantilist theory of money as identical with wealth,
Quesnay says: &#8216;The bulk of money in a nation cannot increase unless this
reproduction itself increases; otherwise, an increase in the bulk of money
would inevitably be prejudicial to the annual production of wealth....
Therefore we must not judge the opulence of states on the basis of a greater
or smaller quantity of money: thus a stock of money, equal to the income
of the landowners, is deemed much more than enough for an agricultural
nation where the circulation proceeds in a regular manner, and where
commerce takes place in confidence and full liberty&#8217; (<i>Analyse du Tableau

circulation, but the assumption is not the correct condition of circulation
within society. Marx himself has given a better exposition in <i>Capital</i>, vol. ii,

irreconcilable with capitalist production, although this does not exclude the
possibility that a certain year in an industrial cycle of ten or eleven years
may not show a smaller total production than the preceding year, so that
there would not have been even a simple reproduction, compared to the
preceding year. Indeed, considering the natural growth of population per
year, simple reproduction could take place only in so far as a correspondingly
larger number of unproductive servants would partake of the 1,500
representing the aggregate surplus-product. But accumulation of capital,
actual capitalist production, would be impossible under such circumstances&#8217;

<p><a name="Footnote_98" id="Footnote_98" href="#FNanchor_98"><span class="label">[98]</span></a>&#8216;The specifically capitalist mode of production, the development of the
productive power of labour corresponding to it, and the change thence
resulting in the organic composition of capital, do not merely keep pace
with the advance of accumulation, or with the growth of social wealth.
They develop at a much quicker rate, because mere accumulation, the
absolute increase of the total social capital, is accompanied by the centralisation
of the individual capitals of which that total is made up; and because
the change in the technological composition of the additional capital goes
hand in hand with a similar change in the technological composition of the
original capital. With the advance of accumulation, therefore, the proportion
of constant to variable capital changes. If it was originally say 1&nbsp;: 1, it
now becomes successively 2&nbsp;: 1, 3&nbsp;: 1, 4&nbsp;: 1, 5&nbsp;: 1, 7&nbsp;: 1, etc., so that, as the capital
increases, instead of <span class="fraction" title="1 half"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></span> of its total value, only <span class="fraction" title="1 third"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></span>, <span class="fraction" title="1 quarter"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></span>, <span class="fraction" title="1 fifth"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub></span>, <span class="fraction" title="1 sixth"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub></span>, <span class="fraction" title="1 eighth"><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub></span>, etc., is transformed
into labour-power, and, on the other hand,  <span class="fraction" title="2 thirds"><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></span>, <span class="fraction" title="3 quarters"><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></span>, <span class="fraction" title="4 fifths"><sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub></span>, <span class="fraction" title="5 sixths"><sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub></span>, <span class="fraction" title="7 eighths"><sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub></span> into means of
production. Since the demand for labour is determined not by the amount
of capital as a whole, but by its variable constituent alone, that demand
falls progressively with the increase of the total capital, instead of, as
previously assumed, rising in proportion to it. It falls relatively to the
magnitude of the total capital, and at an accelerated rate, as this magnitude
increases. With the growth of the total capital, its variable constituent or the
labour incorporated in it, also does increase, but in a constantly diminishing
proportion. The intermediate pauses are shortened, in which accumulation
works as simple extension of production, on a given technical basis. It is not
merely that an accelerated accumulation of total capital, accelerated in a
constantly growing progression, is needed to absorb an additional number
of labourers, or even, on account of the constant metamorphosis of old
capital, to keep employed those already functioning. In its turn, this increasing
accumulation and centralisation becomes a source of new changes in the
composition of capital, of a more accelerated diminution of its variable, as
compared with its constant constituent&#8217; (<i>Capital</i>, vol. i, pp. 642-3).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_99" id="Footnote_99" href="#FNanchor_99"><span class="label">[99]</span></a>&#8216;The course characteristic of modern industry, viz., a decennial cycle
(interrupted by smaller oscillations), of periods of average activity, production
at high pressure, crisis and stagnation, depends on the constant formation,
the greater or less absorption, and the re-formation of the industrial
reserve army or surplus population. In their turn, the varying phases of the
industrial cycle recruit the surplus population, and become one of the most
energetic agents of its reproduction&#8217; (ibid., pp. 646-7).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_147" id="Footnote_147" href="#FNanchor_147"><span class="label">[147]</span></a>In the review of an essay on <i>Observations on the injurious Consequences of the
Restrictions upon Foreign Commerce, by a Member of the late Parliament, London,
1820</i> (<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, vol. lxvi, pp. 331 ff.). This interesting document,
from which the following extracts are taken, an essay with a Free Trade
bias, paints the general position of the workers in England in the most
dismal colours. It gives the facts as follows: &#8216;The manufacturing classes in
Great Britain ... have been suddenly reduced from affluence and prosperity
to the extreme of poverty and misery. In one of the debates in the late
Session of Parliament, it was stated that the wages of weavers of Glasgow
and its vicinity which, when highest, had averaged about 25<i>s.</i> or 27<i>s.</i> a
week, had been reduced in 1816 to 10<i>s.</i>; and in 1819 to the wretched
pittance of 5-6<i>s.</i> or 6<i>s.</i> They have not since been materially augmented.&#8217;
In Lancashire, according to the same evidence, the direct weekly wage of
the weavers was from 6<i>s.</i> to 12<i>s.</i> a week for 15 hours&#8217; labour a day, whilst
half-starved children worked 12 to 16 hours a day for 2<i>s.</i> or 3<i>s.</i> a week.
Distress in Yorkshire was, if possible, even greater. As to the address by the
frame-work knitters of Nottingham, the author says that he himself investigated
conditions and had come to the conclusion that the declarations of
the workers &#8216;were not in the slightest degree exaggerated&#8217;.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_176" id="Footnote_176" href="#FNanchor_176"><span class="label">[176]</span></a>The article in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> was really directed against Owen,
sharply attacking on 24 pages of print the latter&#8217;s four treatises: (1) &#8216;A New
View of Society, or Essays on the formation of Human Character&#8217;, (2)
&#8216;Observations on the Effects of the Manufacturing System&#8217;, (3) &#8216;Two
Memorials on Behalf of the Working Classes, Presented to the Governments
of America and Europe&#8217;, and finally (4) &#8216;Three Tracts&#8217; and &#8216;An Account of
Public Proceedings relative to the Employment of the Poor&#8217;. &#8216;Anonymous&#8217;
here attempts a detailed proof that Owen&#8217;s reformist ideas by no means get
down to the real causes of the misery of the English proletariat, these causes
being: the transition to the cultivation of barren land (Ricardo&#8217;s theory of
ground rent!), the corn laws and high taxation pressing upon farmer and
manufacturer alike. Free trade and <i>laissez-faire</i> thus is his alpha and omega.
Given unrestricted accumulation, all increase in production will create for
itself an increase in demand. Owen is accused of &#8216;profound ignorance&#8217; as
regards Say and James Mill.&mdash;&#8216;In his reasonings, as well as in his plans, Mr.
Owen shows himself profoundly ignorant of all the laws which regulate the
production and distribution of wealth.&#8217;&mdash;From Owen, the author proceeds
to Sismondi and formulates the point of contention as follows: &#8216;He [Owen]
conceives that when competition is unchecked by any artificial regulations,
and industry permitted to flow in its natural channels, the use of machinery
may increase the supply of the several articles of wealth beyond the demand
for them, and by creating an excess of all commodities, throw the working
classes out of employment. This is the position which we hold to be fundamentally
erroneous; and as it is strongly insisted on by the celebrated M. de
Sismondi in his <i>Nouveaux Principes d&#8217;Économie Politique</i>, we must entreat the
indulgence of our readers while we endeavour to point out its fallacy, and to
demonstrate, that the power of consuming necessarily increases with every
increase in the power of producing&#8217; (<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, Oct. 1819, p. 470).</p>

capitalist world, has staged a come-back after 55 years&mdash;in Eugen Duehring&#8217;s
&#8216;system&#8217;. Engels, in his devastating criticism of that unfortunate
&#8216;universal genius&#8217; adduces this idea as proof that Duehring, by attempting
to elucidate a real industrial crisis by means of an imaginary one on the
Leipsic Book Fair, a storm at sea by a storm in a teacup, has shown himself a
&#8216;real German <i>literatus</i>&#8217;. But, as in many other instances exposed by Engels, the
great thinker has simply borrowed here from someone else on the sly.</p>

enjoyed the highest reputation on account of his economic writings, Ricardo
wrote to a friend: &#8216;You will have seen that I have taken my seat in the
House of Commons. I fear I shall be of little use there. I have twice
attempted to speak but I proceeded in the most embarrassed manner, and I
have no hope of conquering the alarm with which I am assailed the moment
I hear the sound of my own voice&#8217; (<i>Letters of D. Ricardo to J. R. MacCulloch</i>,

MacCulloch.</p>

Sismondi tells us about this discussion: &#8216;M. Ricardo, whose recent death
has been a profound bereavement not only to his friends and family but
to all those whom he enlightened by his brilliance, all those whom he
inspired by his lofty sentiments, stayed for some days in Geneva in the last
year of his life. We discussed in two or three sessions this fundamental
question on which we disagreed. To this enquiry he brought the urbanity,
the good faith, the love of truth which distinguished him, and a clarity
which his disciples themselves had not heard, accustomed as they were to the
efforts of abstract thought he demanded in the lecture room.&#8217;</p>

about the controversy between Sismondi and Ricardo (<i>Studies on the Theory
and History of Commercial Crises in England</i>, p. 176), that Sismondi was compelled
&#8216;to acknowledge as correct the doctrine he had attacked and to
concede his opponent all that is necessary&#8217;; that Sismondi himself &#8216;had
abandoned his own theory which still finds so many adherents&#8217;, and that
&#8216;the victory in this controversy lies with Ricardo&#8217;, this shows a lack of discrimination&mdash;to
put it mildly&mdash;such as is practically unheard-of in a work
of serious scientific pretensions.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_210" id="Footnote_210" href="#FNanchor_210"><span class="label">[210]</span></a>&#8216;L&#8217;argent ne remplit qu&#8217;un office passager dans ce double échange. Les
échanges terminés, il se trouve qu&#8217;on a payé des produits avec des produits.
En conséquence, quand une nation a trop de produits dans un genre, le
moyen de les écouler est d&#8217;en créer d&#8217;un autre genre&#8217; (J. B. Say, <i>Traité
d&#8217;Économie Politique</i>, Paris, 1803, vol. i, p. 154).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_211" id="Footnote_211" href="#FNanchor_211"><span class="label">[211]</span></a>In fact, here again, Say&#8217;s only achievement lies in having given a
pompous and dogmatic form to an idea that others had expressed before
him. As Bergmann points out, in his <i>Theory of Crises</i> (Stuttgart, 1895), the
work of Josiah Tucker (1752), Turgot&#8217;s annotations to the French pamphlets,
the writings of Quesnay, Dupont de Nemours, and of others contain
quite similar observations on a natural balance, or even identity, between
demand and supply. Yet the miserable Say, as Marx once called him, claims
credit as the evangelist of harmony for the great discovery of the &#8216;<i>théorie des
débouchés</i>&#8217;, modestly comparing his own work to the discovery of the principles
of thermo-dynamics, of the lever, and of the inclined plane. In the preface
and table of contents, e.g. to the 6th edition of his <i>Traité</i> (1841, pp. 51, 616)
he says: &#8216;The theory of exchange and of vents, such as it is developed in this
work, will transform world politics.&#8217; The same point of view is also expounded
by James Mill in his &#8216;Commerce Defended&#8217; of 1808, and it is he whom Marx
calls the real father of the doctrine of a natural equilibrium between production
and demand.</p>

society in the following ranting peroration: &#8216;It is against the modern organisation
of society, an organisation which, by despoiling the working man of
all property save his hands, gives him no security in the face of a competition
directed towards his detriment. What! Society despoils the working man
because it ensures to every kind of entrepreneur free disposition over his
capital, that is to say his property! I repeat: there is nothing more dangerous
than views conducive to a regulation of the employment of property&#8217; for
&#8216;hands and faculties ... are also property&#8217; (ibid., p. 30).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_221" id="Footnote_221" href="#FNanchor_221"><span class="label">[221]</span></a>Marx, in his history of the opposition to Ricardo&#8217;s school and its dissolution,
makes only brief mention of Sismondi, explaining: &#8216;I leave
Sismondi out of this historical account, because the criticism of his views
belongs to a part with which I can deal only after this treatise, the actual
movement of capital (competition and credit)&#8217; (<i>Theorien über den Mehrwert</i>,
vol. iii, p. 52). Later on, however, in connection with Malthus, he also deals
with Sismondi in a passage that, on the whole, is comprehensive: &#8216;Sismondi
is profoundly aware of the self-contradiction of capitalist production; he
feels that its forms, its productive conditions, spur on an untrammelled
development of the productive forces and of wealth on the one hand, yet
that these conditions, on the other, are only relative; that their contradictions
of value-in-use and value-in-exchange, of commodity and money, of
sale and purchase, of production and consumption, of capital and wage-labour,
and so on, take on ever larger dimensions, along with the forward
strides of the productive forces. In particular, he feels the fundamental conflict:
here the untrammelled development of productive power and of a
wealth which, at the same time, consists in commodities, must be monetised;
and there the basis&mdash;restriction of the mass of producers to the
necessary means of subsistence. He therefore does not, like Ricardo, conceive
of the crises as merely incidental, but as essential, as eruptions of the
immanent conflicts on ever grander scale and at determinate periods. Which
faces him with the dilemma: is the state to put restrictions on the <i>productive
forces</i> to adapt them to the productive conditions, or upon the <i>productive
conditions</i> to adapt them to the <i>productive forces</i>? Frequently he has recourse
to the past, becomes <i>laudator temporis acti</i>, and seeks to master the contradictions
by a different regulation of income relative to capital, or of distribution
relative to production, quite failing to grasp that the relations of distribution
are nothing but the relations of production <i>sub alia specie</i>. He has a perfect
picture of the contradictions immanent in bourgeois production, yet he does
not understand them, and therefore fails also to understand the process of
their disintegration. (And indeed, how could he, seeing this production was
still in the making?&mdash;R.L.) And yet, his view is in fact grounded in the
premonition that <i>new</i> forms of appropriating wealth must answer to the
productive forces, developed in the womb of capitalist production, to the
material and social conditions of creating this wealth; that the bourgeois
forms of appropriation are but transitory and contradictory, wealth existing
always with contrary aspects and presenting itself at once as its opposite.
Wealth is ever based on the premises of poverty, and can develop only by
developing poverty&#8217; (ibid., p. 55).</p>

<p>In <i>The Poverty of Philosophy</i>, Marx opposes Sismondi to Proudhon in sundry
passages, yet about the man himself he only remarks tersely: &#8216;Those, who,
like Sismondi, wish to return to the true proportions of production, while
preserving the present basis of society, are reactionary, since, to be consistent,
they must also wish to bring back all the other conditions of industry
of former times&#8217; (<i>The Poverty of Philosophy</i>, London, 1936, p. 57). Two short
references to Sismondi are in <i>On the Critique of Political Economy</i>: once he is
ranked, as the last classic of bourgeois economics in France, with Ricard in
England; in another passage emphasis is laid on the fact that Sismondi, contrary
to Ricardo, underlined the specifically social character of labour that
creates value.&mdash;In the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>, finally, Sismondi is mentioned as
the head of the petty-bourgeois school.</p>

Rodbertus appears in practice as an extremely sober and realistically-minded
prophet of capitalist colonial policy, in the manner of the present-day
&#8216;Pan-Germans&#8217;, his moral ranting about the unhappy fate of the working
classes notwithstanding. In a footnote to the above quotation, he writes:
&#8216;We can go on to glance briefly at the importance of the opening up of Asia,
in particular of China and Japan, the richest markets in the world, and also
of the maintenance of English rule in India. It is to defer the solution of the
social problem.&#8217; (The eloquent avenger of the exploited ingenuously discloses
the means by which the profiteering exploiters can continue &#8216;their
stupid and criminal error&#8217;, their &#8216;flagrant injustice&#8217; for as long as possible.)
&#8216;For the solution of this problem, the present lacks in unselfishness and
moral resolution no less than in intelligence.&#8217; (Rodbertus&#8217; philosophical
resignation is unparalleled!) &#8216;Economic advantage cannot, admittedly, constitute
a legal title to intervention by force, but on the other hand, a strict
application of modern natural and international law to all the nations of the
world, whatever their state of civilisation, is quite impracticable.&#8217; (A comparison
with Dorine&#8217;s words in Molière&#8217;s <i>Tartuffe</i> is irresistible: &#8216;Le ciel
défend, de vraie, certains contentements, mais il y a avec lui des accommodements.&#8217;)&mdash;&#8216;Our
international law has grown from a civilisation of <i>Christian</i>
ethics, and since all law is based upon reciprocity, it can only provide the
standard for relations between nations of the same civilisation. If it is applied
beyond these limits, it is sentiment rather than natural and international
law and the Indian atrocities should have cured us of it. Christian Europe
should rather partake of the spirit which made the Greeks and the Romans
regard all the other peoples of the world as barbarians. The younger European
nations might then regain the drive for making world history which
impelled the Ancients to spread their native civilisation over the countries of
the globe. They would reconquer Asia for world history by <i>joint action</i>. Such
common purpose and action would in turn stimulate the greatest social
progress, a firm foundation of peace in Europe, a reduction of armies, a
colonisation of Asia in the ancient Roman style&mdash;in other words, a genuine
solidarity of interests in all walks of social life.&#8217; The vision of capitalist
colonial expansion inspires the prophet of the exploited and oppressed to
almost poetical flights, all the more remarkable for coming at a time when
a civilisation of Christian ethics accomplished such glorious exploits as the
Opium Wars against China and the Indian atrocities&mdash;that is to say, the
atrocities committed by the British in their bloody suppression of the Indian
Mutiny.&mdash;In his second <i>Letter on Social Problems</i>, in 1850, Rodbertus had
expressed the conviction that if society lacks the &#8216;moral resolution&#8217; necessary
to solve the social question, in other words, to change the distribution of
wealth, history would be forced to &#8216;use the whip of revolution against it&#8217;
(op. cit., vol. ii, p. 83). Eight years later, however, the stalwart Prussian
prefers to crack the whip of a colonial policy of Christian ethics over the
natives of the colonial countries. It is, of course, what one might expect of
the &#8216;original founder of scientific socialism in Germany&#8217; that he should also
be a warm supporter of militarism, and his phrase about the &#8216;reduction of
armies&#8217; is but poetic licence in his verbal fireworks. In his essay <i>On the
Understanding of the Social Question</i> he explains that the &#8216;entire national tax
burden is perpetually gravitating towards the bottom, sometimes in form
of higher prices for wage goods, and sometimes in form of lower money
wages&#8217;. In this connection, he considers conscription &#8216;under the aspect of
a charge on the state&#8217;, explaining that &#8216;as far as the working classes are
concerned, it is nothing like a tax but rather a confiscation of their entire
income for many years&#8217;. He adds immediately: &#8216;To avoid misunderstanding
I would point out that I am a staunch supporter of our present military
constitution (i.e. the military constitution of counter-revolutionary Prussia)&mdash;although
it may be oppressive to the working classes and demand great
financial sacrifices from the propertied classes&#8217; (op. cit., vol. iii, p. 34). That
does not even sound like a lion&#8217;s roar!</p>

had evolved as early as 1842 in his <i>Towards the Understanding of Our
Politico-Economic Conditions</i>. &#8216;Under present conditions, we have, however,
gone so far as to consider not only the wage of labour part of the costs of the
goods, but also rents and capital profits. We must therefore refute this
opinion in detail. It has a twofold foundation: (<i>a</i>) a wrong conception of
capital which counts the wage of labour as part of the capital just like
materials and tools, while it is on the same level as rent and profit; (<i>b</i>) a
confusion of the costs of the commodity and the advances of the entrepreneur
or the costs of the enterprise&#8217; (<i>Towards the Understanding of Our Politico-Economic
Conditions</i>, Neubrandenburg &amp; Friedland, G. Barnovitz, 1842, p. 14).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_272" id="Footnote_272" href="#FNanchor_272"><span class="label">[272]</span></a><i>Schriften</i>, vol. i, p. 304. Just so already in <i>Towards the Understanding of Our
Politico-Economic Conditions</i>, &#8216;We must distinguish between capital in its
narrow or proper sense, and the fund of enterprise, or capital in a wider
sense. The former comprises the actual reserves in tools and materials, the
latter the fund necessary for running an enterprise under present conditions
of division of labour. The former is capital absolutely necessary to production,
and the latter achieves such relative necessity only by force of present
conditions. Hence only the former is capital in the strict and proper meaning
of the term; this alone is completely congruent with the concept of national
capital&#8217; (ibid., pp. 23-4).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_276" id="Footnote_276" href="#FNanchor_276"><span class="label">[276]</span></a>A memorial of the worst kind, by the way, was that of the editors who
published his works after his death. These learned gentlemen, Messrs.
Wagner, Kozak, Moritz Wuertz &amp; Co., quarrelled in the prefaces to his
posthumous writings like a rough crowd of ill-mannered servants in an
antechamber, fighting out publicly their petty personal feuds and jealousies,
and slanging one another. They did not even bother in common decency
to establish the dates for the individual manuscripts they had found. To take
an instance, it needed Mehring to observe that the oldest manuscript of
Rodbertus that had been found was not published in 1837, as laid down
autocratically by Prof. Wagner, but in 1839 at the earliest, since it refers
in its opening paragraphs to historical events connected with the Chartist
movement belonging, as a professor of economics really ought to know, in
the year 1839. In Professor Wagner&#8217;s introduction to Rodbertus we are
constantly bored by his pomposity, his harping on the &#8216;excessive demands
on his time&#8217;; in any case Wagner addresses himself solely to his learned
colleagues and talks above the heads of the common crowd; he passes over
in silence, as befits a great man, Mehring&#8217;s elegant correction before the
assembled experts. Just as silently, Professor Diehl altered the date of 1837
to 1839 in the <i>Handwörterbuch der Staatswissenschaften</i>, without a word to say
when and by whom he had been thus enlightened.</p>

<p>But the final touch is provided by the &#8216;popular&#8217;, &#8216;new and inexpensive&#8217;
edition of Puttkamer and Muehlbrecht (1899). Some of the quarrelling
editors collaborated on it but still continue their disputes in the introductions.
Wagner&#8217;s former vol. ii has become vol. i in this edition, yet Wagner
still refers to vol. ii in the introduction to vol. i. The first <i>Letter on Social
Problems</i> is placed in vol. iii, the second and third in vol. ii and the fourth in
vol. i. The order of the <i>Letters on Social Problems</i>, of the <i>Controversies</i>, of the
parts of <i>Towards the Understanding</i> ..., chronological and logical sequence,
the dates of publication and of writing are hopelessly mixed up, making a
chaos more impenetrable than the stratification of the soil after repeated
volcanic eruptions. 1837 is maintained as the date of Rodbertus&#8217; earliest
MS., probably out of respect to Professor Wagner&mdash;and this in 1899,
although Mehring&#8217;s rectification had been made in 1894. If we compare this
with Marx&#8217;s literary heritage in Mehring&#8217;s and Kautsky&#8217;s edition, published
by Dietz, we see how such apparently superficial matters but reflect deeper
connections: one kind of care for the scientific heritage of the authority of the
class-conscious proletariat, and quite another in which the official experts of
the bourgeoisie squander the heritage of a man who, in their own self-interested
legends, had been a first-rate genius. <i>Suum cuique</i>&mdash;had this not
been the motto of Rodbertus?</p>

Russian situation differently. He repeatedly tries to convince Nikolayon that
Russia cannot avoid a high industrial development, and that her sufferings
are nothing but the typical capitalist contradictions. Thus he writes on
September 22, 1892: &#8216;I therefore hold that at present industrial production
necessarily implies big industry, making use of steam power, electricity,
mechanical looms and frames, and lastly the manufacture of the machines
themselves by mechanical means. From the moment that railways are introduced
in Russia, recourse to all these extremely modern means of production
becomes inevitable. It is necessary that you should be able to mend and
repair your engines, coaches, railways and the like, but to do this cheaply,
you must also be in a position to make at home the things needing repair.
As soon as the technique of war has become a branch of industry (armour-plated
cruisers, modern artillery, machine guns, steel bullets, smokeless gun
powder, etc.) a big industry that is indispensable for the production of such
items has become a political necessity for you as well. All these items cannot
be made without a highly developed metal industry which on its part cannot
develop unless there is a corresponding development of all other branches of
production, textiles in particular&#8217; (Marx-Engels to Nikolayon, St. Petersburg,
1908, p. 75). And further in the same letter: &#8216;So long as Russian
industry depends on the home market alone, it can only satisfy the internal
demand. The latter, however, can grow but slowly, and it seems to me that
under present conditions of life in Russia it is even bound to decrease, since
it is one of the unavoidable consequences of high industrial development that
it destroys its own home market by the same process which served to create
it: by destroying the bases of the peasants&#8217; domestic industry. Yet peasants
cannot live without such a domestic industry. They are ruined as peasants,
their purchasing power is reduced to a minimum, and unless they grow
new roots in new conditions of life, unless they become proletarians, they
will only represent a very small market for the newly arising plants and
factories.</p>

<p>&#8216;Capitalist production is a phase of economic transition, full of inherent
contradictions which only develop and become visible to the extent that
capitalist production develops. The tendency of simultaneously creating and
destroying a market is just one of these contradictions. Another is the hopeless
situation that will ensue, all the sooner in a country like Russia which
lacks external markets than in countries more or less fit to compete in the
open world market. These latter can find some means of relief in this seemingly
hopeless situation by heroic measures of commercial policy, that is to
say by forcibly opening up new markets. China is the most recent market to
be opened up for English commerce, and it proved adequate for a temporary
revival of prosperity. That is why English capital is so insistent on railroad
building in China. Yet railways in China mean the destruction of the entire
foundation of China&#8217;s small rural enterprises and her domestic industry. In
this case, there is not even a native big industry developed to compensate
for this evil to some extent, and hundreds of millions will consequently find
it impossible to make a living at all. The result will be mass emigration,
such as the world has never yet seen, and America, Asia and Europe will be
flooded with the detested Chinese. This new competitor on the labour
market will compete with American, Australian and European labour at the
level of what the Chinese consider a satisfactory standard of living, which is
well known to be the lowest in the whole world. Well then, if the whole
system of production in Europe has not been revolutionised by then, that
will be the time to start this revolution&#8217; (ibid., p. 79).</p>

<p>Engels, though he followed Russian developments with attention and
keen interest, persistently refused to take an active part in the Russian dispute.
In his letter of November 24, 1894, i.e. shortly before his death, he
expressed himself as follows: &#8216;My Russian friends almost daily and weekly
bombard me with requests to come forward with my objections to Russian
books and reviews which not only misinterpret but even misquote the sayings
of our author (Marx). My friends assure me that my intervention
would suffice to put matters right. Yet I invariably and firmly refuse all
such proposals because I cannot afford to become involved with a dispute
held in a foreign country, in a tongue which I, at least, cannot read as easily
and freely as the more familiar W. European languages, and in a literature
which is at best accessible to me only in fortuitous glimpses of some fragments,
and which I cannot pursue anything like systematically enough in
all its stages and details without neglecting my real and serious work. There
are people everywhere who, once they have taken up a certain stand, are not
ashamed to have recourse to misinterpreting the thoughts of others and to all
kinds of dishonest manipulations for their own ends, and if that is what has
happened to our author, I am afraid they will not deal more kindly with
me, so that in the end I shall be compelled to interfere in the dispute, first
to defend others, and then in my own defence&#8217; (ibid., p. 90).</p>

and Vorontsov in particular, to the last remained loyal to their views,
in spite of all that happened in Russia&mdash;a fact that does more credit to their
character than to their intelligence. Referring to the 1900 and 1902 crises,
Vorontsov wrote in 1902: &#8216;The doctrinaire dogma of the Neo-Marxists
rapidly loses its power over people&#8217;s minds. That the newest successes of the
individualists are ephemeral has obviously dawned even on their official
advocates.... In the first decade of the twentieth century, we come back
to the same views about economic development in Russia that had been the
legacy of the 1870&#8217;s&#8217; (Cf. the review <i>Political Economics</i>, October 1902,
quoted by A. Finn Yenotayevski in <i>The Contemporary Economy of Russia
1890-1910</i>, St. Petersburg, 1911, p. 2.) Even to-day, then, this last of the
&#8216;populist&#8217; Mohicans deduces the &#8216;ephemeral character&#8217;, not of his own
theory, but of economic reality. What of the saying of Barrère: &#8216;Il n&#8217;y a que

what he calls the pessimist outlook on the analogy of the U.S.A. is fallacious.
He says that Russia can overcome the evil consequences of the most recent
capitalism just as easily as the U.S.A. But what he forgets is that the U.S.A.
from the first represent a new bourgeois state, that they were founded by a
petty bourgeoisie and by peasants who had fled from European feudalism
to set up a purely bourgeois society. In Russia, on the other hand, we have
a primitive communist foundation, a society of <i>gentes</i>, as it were, in the pre-civilised
stage which, though it is already disintegrating, still serves as a
material basis upon which the capitalist revolution (for it is in fact a social
revolution) can take place and become effective. In America, a monetary
economy had been stabilised more than a century ago, whereas a natural
economy had until recently prevailed in Russia. It should be obvious therefore
that this revolution in Russia is bound to be much more ruthless and
violent, and accompanied by immensely more suffering than in America&#8217;

<p><a name="Footnote_299" id="Footnote_299" href="#FNanchor_299"><span class="label">[299]</span></a>Professor Schmoller, amongst others, clearly reveals the reactionary
aspect of the &#8216;Three Empire Theory&#8217; (viz. Great Britain, Russia and the
U.S.A.) evolved by the German professors. In his handbook of commercial
policy (<i>Handelspolitische Säkularbetrachtung</i>), the venerable scholar dolefully
frowns upon &#8216;neo-mercantilism&#8217;, that is to say upon the imperialist designs
of the three arch-villains. &#8216;In the interests of a higher intellectual, moral and
aesthetic civilisation and social progress&#8217; he demands a strong German navy
and a European Customs Union. &#8216;Out of the economic tension of the world
there arises the prime duty for Germany to create for herself a strong navy,
so as to be prepared for battle in the case of need, and to be desirable as an
ally to the World Powers&#8217;&mdash;which latter, however, Professor Schmoller says
elsewhere, he does not wish to blame for again taking the path of large-scale
colonial expansion. &#8216;She neither can nor ought to pursue a policy of conquest
like the Three World Powers, but she must be able, if necessary, to break
a foreign blockade of the North Sea in order to protect her own colonies and
her vast commerce, and she must be able to offer the same security to the
states with whom she forms an alliance. It is the task of the Three-Partite
Union (Germany, Austro-Hungary, and Italy) to co-operate with France
towards imposing some restraint, desirable for the preservation of all other
states, on the over-aggressive policy of the Three World Powers which constitutes
a threat to all smaller states, and to ensure moderation in conquests,
in colonial acquisitions, in the immoderate and unilateral policy of protective
tariffs, in the exploitation and maltreatment of all weaker elements.
The objectives of all higher intellectual, moral and aesthetic civilisation and
of social progress depend on the fact that the globe should not be divided
up among Three World Empires in the twentieth century, that these Three
Empires should not establish a brutal neo-mercantilism&#8217; (<i>Die Wandlungen der

5th edition, p. 147. Professor Sombart&#8217;s theory is the most recent
contribution in this field. He argues that we are not moving towards an
international economy but rather farther and farther away from it. &#8216;I maintain,
on the contrary, that commercial relations to-day do not form a
stronger but rather a weaker link between the civilised nations, in relation
to their economy as a whole. Individual economy takes not more but rather
less account of the world market than it did a hundred or fifty years ago.
At least ... it would be wrong to assume that the relative importance of
international relations with regard to modern political economy is increasing.
The opposite is the case.&#8217; Sombart scornfully rejects the assumption of
a progressive international division of labour, of a growing need for outside
markets owing to an inelastic home demand. He in his turn is convinced
that &#8216;the individual national economies will develop into ever more perfect
microcosms and that the importance of the home market will increasingly
surpass that of the world market for all branches of industry&#8217; (<i>Die Deutsche
Volkswirtschaft im 19. Jahrhundert</i>, 2nd edition, 1909, pp. 399-420). This
devastating discovery admittedly hinges on a full acceptance of the Professor&#8217;s
peculiar conception which, for some reasons, only considers those as
&#8216;exporting countries&#8217; who pay for their imports with a surplus of agricultural
products over and above their own needs, who pay &#8216;with the soil&#8217;. In this
scheme Russia, Rumania, the U.S.A. and the Argentine are, but Germany,
England and Belgium are not, &#8216;exporting countries&#8217;. Since capitalist
development will sooner or later also claim the surplus of agricultural products
for the home demand in Russia and the U.S.A., it is evident that there
will be fewer and fewer &#8216;exporting countries&#8217; in the world&mdash;international
economy will vanish.&mdash;Another of Sombart&#8217;s discoveries is that great
capitalist &#8216;non-exporting&#8217; countries increasingly obtain &#8216;free&#8217; imports in
form of interest on exported capital&mdash;but the capital exports as well as
exports of industrial commodities are of absolutely no account to Professor
Sombart. &#8216;In the course of time we shall probably get to a point where we
import without exporting&#8217; (p. 422). Modern, sensational, and precious!</p>

given by V. Ilyin [Lenin]: &#8216;The romanticists (as he calls the sceptics) argue
as follows: the capitalists cannot consume the surplus value; therefore they
must dispose of it abroad. I ask: Do the capitalists perhaps give away their
products to foreigners for nothing, throw it into the sea, maybe? If they sell
it, it means that they obtain an equivalent. If they export certain goods, it
means that they import others&#8217; (<i>Economic Studies and Essays</i>, p. 2). As a
matter of fact, his explanation of the part played by external commerce
in capitalist production is far more correct than that of Struve and Bulgakov.</p>

the statement that enlarged reproduction begins only with capitalism. It
quite escapes him that under conditions of simple reproduction, which he
takes to be the rule for all pre-capitalist modes of production, we should
probably never have advanced beyond the stage of the paleolithic scraper.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_327" id="Footnote_327" href="#FNanchor_327"><span class="label">[327]</span></a><i>Die Neue Zeit</i>, vol. xx, part 2, <i>Krisentheorien</i>, p. 116. Kautsky&#8217;s mathematical
demonstration to Tugan Baranovski that consumption is bound to
grow, and &#8216;in the precise ratio as the bulk of producer goods in terms of
value&#8217;, calls for two comments: first, like Marx, Kautsky paid no attention
to the progress in the productivity of labour so that consumption appears to
have a relatively larger volume than it would in fact have. Secondly, the
increase in consumption to which Kautsky here refers is only a consequence,
a result of enlarged reproduction, it is neither its basis nor its aim;
it is mainly due to the growth of the variable capital, the continual employment
of additional workers. The upkeep of these workers, however, neither is
nor ought to be the object of the expansion of reproduction&mdash;no more, for
that matter, than the increasing personal consumption of the capitalist class.
Kautsky&#8217;s argument no doubt refutes Tugan Baranovski&#8217;s pet notion: the
whimsy to construe enlarged reproduction with an absolute decrease in
consumption. But for all that, he does not get anywhere near the fundamental
problem, the relations between production and consumption under
the aspect of the reproductive process, though we are told in another passage
of the same work: &#8216;With the capitalists growing richer, and the workers they
exploit increasing in numbers, they constitute between them a market for
the consumer goods produced by capitalist big industry which expands continually,
yet it does not grow as rapidly as the accumulation of capital and
the productivity of labour, and must therefore remain inadequate.&#8217; An
additional market is required for these consumer goods, a market outside
their own province, among those occupational groups and nations whose
mode of production is not yet capitalistic. This market is found and also
widens increasingly, but the expansion is again too slow, since the additional
market is not nearly so elastic and capable of expansion as the capitalist
productive process. As soon as capitalist production has developed to the big
industry stage, as in England already in the first quarter of the nineteenth
century, it is capable of expanding by leaps and bounds so as soon to out-distance
all expansions of the market. Every period of prosperity subsequent
to a considerable extension of the market is thus from the outset doomed to
an early end&mdash;the inevitable crisis. This, in brief, is the theory of crises
established by Marx, and, as far as we can see, generally accepted by the
&#8220;orthodox&#8221; Marxists&#8217; (ibid., p. 80). Kautsky, however, is not interested in
harmonising this conception of the realisation of the aggregate product with
Marx&#8217;s diagram of enlarged reproduction, perhaps because, as our quotation
also shows, he deals with the problem solely from the aspect of crises, regarding,
in other words, the social product as a more or less homogeneous bulk
of goods and ignoring the fact that it is differentiated in the reproductive
process.</p>

<p>L. Bouding seems to come closer to the crucial point. In his brilliant
review on Tugan Baranovski he gives the following formulation: &#8216;With a
single exception to be considered below, the existence of a surplus product
in capitalist countries does not put a spoke in the wheel of production, not
because production will be distributed more efficiently among the various
spheres, or because the manufacture of machinery will replace that of cotton
goods. The reason is rather that, capitalist development having begun
sooner in some countries than in others, and because even to-day there are
still some countries that have no developed capitalism, the capitalist countries
in truth have at their disposal an outside market in which they can get
rid of their products which they cannot consume themselves, no matter
whether these are cotton or iron goods. We would by no means deny that it
is significant if iron goods replace cotton goods as the main products of the
principal capitalist countries. On the contrary, this change is of paramount
importance, but its implications are rather different from those ascribed to
it by Tugan Baranovski. It indicates the beginning of the end of capitalism.
So long as the capitalist countries exported commodities for the purpose of
consumption, there was still a hope for capitalism in these countries, and the
question did not arise how much and how long the non-capitalist outside
world would be able to absorb capitalist commodities. The growing share of
machinery at the cost of consumer goods in what is exported from the main
capitalist countries shows that areas which were formerly free of capitalism,
and therefore served as a dumping-ground for its surplus products, are now
drawn into the whirlpool of capitalism. It shows that, since they are developing
a capitalism of their own, they can by themselves produce the consumer
goods they need. At present they still require machinery produced by
capitalist methods since they are only in the initial stages of capitalist
development. But all too soon they will need them no longer. Just as they
now make their own cotton and other consumer goods, they will in future
produce their own iron ware. Then they will not only cease to absorb the
surplus produce of the essentially capitalist countries, but they will themselves
produce surplus products which they can place only with difficulty&#8217;
(<i>Die Neue Zeit</i>, vol. xxv, part 1, <i>Mathematische Formeln gegen Karl Marx</i>,
p. 604). Bouding here broaches an important aspect of the general relations
pertaining to the development of international capitalism. Further, as a
logical consequence, he comes to the question of imperialism but unfortunately
he finally puts the wrong kind of edge on his acute analysis by considering
the whole of militarist production together with the system of exporting
international capital to non-capitalist countries under the heading of &#8216;reckless
expenditure&#8217;.&mdash;We must say in parenthesis that Bouding, just like
Kautsky, holds that the law of a quicker growth in the means-of-production
department relative to the means-of-subsistence department is a delusion of
Tugan Baranovski&#8217;s.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_328" id="Footnote_328" href="#FNanchor_328"><span class="label">[328]</span></a>&#8216;Apart from natural conditions, such as fertility of the soil, etc., and
from the skill of independent and isolated producers (shown rather qualitatively
in the genus than quantitatively in the mass of their products), the
degree of productivity of labour, in a capitalist society, is expressed in the
relative extent of the means of production that one labourer, during a given
time, with the same tension of labour-power, turns into products. The mass
of means of production which he thus transforms, increases with the productiveness
of his labour. But those means of production play a double part.
The increase of some is a consequence, that of the others a condition of the
increasing productivity of labour. E.g., with the division of labour in manufacture,
and with the use of machinery, more raw material is worked up in
the same time and, therefore, a greater mass of raw material and auxiliary
substances enter into the labour-process. That is the consequence of the
increasing productivity of labour. On the other hand, the mass of machinery,
beasts of burden, mineral manures, drainpipes, etc., is a condition of the
increasing productivity of labour. So also is it with the means of production
concentrated in buildings, furnaces, means of transport, etc. But whether
condition or consequence, the growing extent of the means of production, as
compared with the labour-power incorporated with them, is an expression
of the growing productiveness of labour. The increase of the latter appears,
therefore, in the diminution of the mass of labour in proportion to the mass
of means of production moved by it, or in the diminution of the subjective
factor of the labour-process as compared with the objective factor&#8217; (<i>Capital</i>,
vol. i, pp. 635-6). And yet another passage: &#8216;We have seen previously, that
with the development of the productivity of labour, and therefore with the
development of the capitalist mode of production, which develops the
socially productive power of labour more than all previous modes of production,
there is a steady increase of the mass of means of production, which are
permanently embodied in the productive process as instruments of labour
and perform their function in it for a longer or shorter time at repeated
intervals (buildings, machinery, etc.); also, that this increase is at the same
time the premise and result of the development of the productivity of social
labour. It is especially capitalist production, which is characterised by
relative as well as absolute growth of this sort of wealth&#8217; (<i>Capital</i>, vol. i,
chap. xxiii, 2). &#8216;The material forms of existence of constant capital, the
means of production, do not consist merely of such instruments of labour,
but also of raw material in various stages of finished and of auxiliary substances.
With the enlargement of the scale of production and the increase in
the productivity of labour by co-operation, division of labour, machinery,
etc., the mass of raw materials and auxiliary substances used in the daily
process of reproduction, grows likewise&#8217; (<i>Capital</i>, vol. ii, p. 160).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_329" id="Footnote_329" href="#FNanchor_329"><span class="label">[329]</span></a>Struve says in the preface to the collection of his Russian essays (published
in 1901): &#8216;In 1894, when the author published his &#8220;Critical Comments
on the Problem of Economic Development in Russia&#8221;, he inclined in philosophy
towards positivism, in sociology and economics towards outspoken,
though by no means orthodox, Marxism. Since then, the author no longer
sees the whole truth in positivism and Marxism which is grounded in it (!),
they no longer fully determine his view of the world. Malignant dogmatism
which not only browbeats those who think differently, but spies upon their
morals and psychology, regards such work as a mere &#8220;Epicurean instability
of mind&#8221;. It cannot understand that criticism in its own right is to the living
and thinking individual one of the most valuable rights. The author does not
intend to renounce this right, though he might constantly be in danger of
being indicted for &#8220;instability&#8221;&#8217; (<i>Miscellany</i>, St. Petersburg, 1901).</p>

for English exports:</p>

<p>In 1893, cotton exports to the amount of £64,000,000 made up 23 per
cent, and iron and other metal exports not quite 17 per cent, of the total
export of manufactured goods, amounting to £277,000,000 in all.</p>

<p>In 1898, cotton exports to the amount of £65,000,000 made up 28 per
cent, and metal exports 22 per cent, of the total export of manufactured
goods, amounting to £233,400,000 in all.</p>

<p>In comparison, the figures for the German Empire show the following
result: In 1898, cotton exports to the amount of £11,595,000 made up
5·75 per cent of the total exports, amounting to £200,500,000. 5,250,000,000
yards of cotton bales were exported in 1898, 2,250,000,000 of them to India
(E. Jaffé: <i>Die englische Baumwollindustrie und die Organisation des Exporthandels</i>.

<p>In 1908, British exports of cotton yarn alone amounted to £13,100,000

appropriate the means of production of the primitive countries by exploitation
on the greatest scale. Since 1900, this company, financed by English
and foreign capitalists, has thrown upon the London market approximately
4,000 tons of Putumayo rubber. During this time, 30,000 natives were killed

surplus value, of the surplus means of subsistence produced, must then be
converted into variable capital for the purpose of purchasing new labour.
This can only be done if the number of workers grows or if their working
time is prolonged.... This, however, cannot be considered a ready measure
for accumulation. The working population can increase if formerly unproductive
workers are transformed into productive ones, or if parts of the
population who previously performed no work, such as women, children
and paupers, are drawn into the process of production. Here, however, we
shall ignore this aspect. Lastly, the working population can increase through
an absolute increase in population. If accumulation is to proceed steadily
and continuously, it must be grounded in an absolute growth of the population,
though this may decline in comparison with the capital employed. An
expanding population appears as the basis of accumulation conceived as a
steady process. An indispensable condition for this is an average wage which
is adequate not only to the reproduction of the working population but
permits its continual increase&#8217; (<i>Theorien über den Mehrwert</i>, vol. ii, part 2, in

<p><a name="Footnote_354" id="Footnote_354" href="#FNanchor_354"><span class="label">[354]</span></a>Bryce, a former English Minister, describes a model pattern of such
hybrid forms in the South African diamond mines: &#8216;The most striking sight
at Kimberley, and one unique in the world, is furnished by the two so-called
&#8220;compounds&#8221; in which the natives who work in the mines are housed and
confined. They are huge inclosures, unroofed, but covered with a wire
netting to prevent anything from being thrown out of them over the walls,
and with a subterranean entrance to the adjoining mine. The mine is
worked on the system of three eight-hour shifts, so that the workman is never
more than eight hours together underground. Round the interior of the wall
are built sheds or huts in which the natives live and sleep when not working.
A hospital is also provided within the inclosure, as well as a school where
the work-people can spend their leisure in learning to read and write. No
spirits are sold.... Every entrance is strictly guarded, and no visitors, white
or native, are permitted, all supplies being obtained from the store within,
kept by the company. The De Beers mine compound contained at the time
of my visit 2,600 natives, belonging to a great variety of tribes, so that here
one could see specimens of the different native types from Natal and Pondoland,
in the south, to the shores of Lake Tanganyika in the far north. They
come from every quarter, attracted by the high wages, usually eighteen to
thirty shillings a week, and remain for three months or more, and occasionally
even for longer periods.... In the vast oblong compound one sees Zulus
from Natal, Fingos, Pondos, Tembus, Basutos, Bechuanas, Gungunhana&#8217;s
subjects from the Portuguese territories, some few Matabili and Makalaka;
and plenty of Zambesi boys from the tribes on both sides of that great river,
a living ethnological collection such as can be examined nowhere else in
South Africa. Even Bushmen, or at least natives with some Bushman blood
in them, are not wanting. They live peaceably together, and amuse themselves
in their several ways during their leisure hours. Besides games of
chance, we saw a game resembling &#8220;fox and geese&#8221; played with pebbles on a
board; and music was being discoursed on two rude native instruments, the
so-called &#8220;Kaffir piano&#8221; made of pieces of iron of unequal length fastened
side by side in a frame, and a still ruder contrivance of hard bits of wood,
also of unequal size, which when struck by a stick emit different notes, the
first beginning of a tune. A very few were reading or writing letters, the rest
busy with their cooking or talking to one another. Some tribes are incessant
talkers, and in this strange mixing-pot of black men one may hear a dozen
languages spoken as one passes from group to group&#8217; (James Bryce, <i>Impressions
of South Africa</i>, London, 1897, pp. 242 ff.).</p>

<p>After several months of work, the negro as a rule leaves the mine with the
wages he has saved up. He returns to his tribe, buying a wife with his money,
and lives again his traditional life. Cf. also in the same book the most lively
description of the methods used in South Africa to solve the &#8216;labour-problem&#8217;.
Here we are told that the negroes are compelled to work in the
mines and plantations of Kimberley, Witwatersrand, Natal, Matabeleland,
by stripping them of all land and cattle, i.e. depriving them of their means of
existence, by making them into proletarians and also demoralising them
with alcohol. (Later, when they are already within the &#8216;enclosure&#8217; of capital,
spirits, to which they have just been accustomed, are strictly prohibited&mdash;the
object of exploitation must be kept fit for use.) Finally, they are simply
pressed into the wage system of capital by force, by imprisonment, and
flogging.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_355" id="Footnote_355" href="#FNanchor_355"><span class="label">[355]</span></a>The relations between Germany and England provide a typical
example.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_356" id="Footnote_356" href="#FNanchor_356"><span class="label">[356]</span></a>Mill, in his <i>History of British India</i>, substantiates the thesis that under
primitive conditions the land belongs always and everywhere to the sovereign,
on evidence collected at random and quite indiscriminately from the
most varied sources (Mungo Park, Herodotus, Volney, Acosta, Garcilasso
de la Vega, Abbé Grosier, Barrow, Diodorus, Strabo and others). Applying
this thesis to India, he goes on to say: &#8216;From these facts only one conclusion
can be drawn, that the property of the soil resided in the sovereign; for if it
did not reside in him, it will be impossible to show to whom it belonged&#8217;
(James Mill, <i>History of British India</i> (4th edition, 1840), vol. i, p. 311). Mill&#8217;s
editor, H. H. Wilson who, as Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford University,
was thoroughly versed in the legal relations of Ancient India, gives an
interesting commentary to this classical deduction. Already in his preface he
characterises the author as a partisan who has juggled with the whole history
of British India in order to justify the theories of Mr. Bentham and who,
with this end, has used the most dubious means for his portrait of the Hindus
which in no way resembles the original and almost outrages humanity. He
appends the following footnote to our quotation: &#8216;The greater part of the
text and of the notes here is wholly irrelevant. The illustrations drawn from
the Mahometan practice, supposing them to be correct, have nothing to do
with the laws and rights of the Hindus. They are not, however, even accurate
and Mr. Mill&#8217;s guides have misled him.&#8217; Wilson then contests outright the
theory of the sovereign&#8217;s right of ownership in land, especially with reference
to India. (Ibid., p. 305, footnote.) Henry Maine, too, is of the opinion that
the British attempted to derive their claim to Indian land from the Mahometans
in the first place, and he recognises this claim to be completely unjustified.
&#8216;The assumption which the English first made was one which they
inherited from their Mahometan predecessors. It was that all the soil
belonged in absolute property to the sovereign,&mdash;and that all private property
in land existed by his sufferance. The Mahometan theory and the
corresponding Mahometan practice had put out of sight the ancient view
of the sovereign&#8217;s rights which, though it assigned to him a far larger share
of the produce of the land than any Western ruler has ever claimed, yet in
nowise denied the existence of private property in land&#8217; (<i>Village Communities
in the East and West</i> (5th edition, vol. 2, 1890), p. 104). Maxim Kovalevski,
on the other hand, has proved thoroughly that this alleged &#8216;Mahometan
theory and practice&#8217; is an exclusively British legend. (Cf. his excellent study,
written in Russian, <i>On the Causes, the Development and the Consequences of the
Disintegration of Communal Ownership of Land</i> (Moscow, 1879), part i.) Incidentally,
British experts and their French colleagues at the time of writing
maintain an analogous legend about China, for example, asserting that all
the land there had been the Emperor&#8217;s property. (Cf. the refutation of this
legend by Dr. O. Franke, <i>Die Rechtsverhältnisse am Grundeigentum in China</i>,
1903.)</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_357" id="Footnote_357" href="#FNanchor_357"><span class="label">[357]</span></a>&#8216;The partitions of inheritances and execution for debt levied on land are
destroying the communities&mdash;this is the formula heard nowadays everywhere
in India&#8217; (Henry Maine, op. cit., p. 113).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_358" id="Footnote_358" href="#FNanchor_358"><span class="label">[358]</span></a>This view of British colonial policy, expounded e.g. by Lord Roberts of
Kandahar (for many years a representative of British power in India) is
typical. He can give no other explanation for the Sepoy Mutiny than mere
&#8216;misunderstandings&#8217; of the paternal intentions of the British rulers. &#8216;... the
alleged unfairness of what was known in India as the land settlement, under
which system the right and title of each landholder to his property was
examined, and the amount of revenue to be paid by him to the paramount
Power, as owner of the soil, was regulated ... as peace and order were
established, the system of land revenue, which had been enforced in an
extremely oppressive and corrupt manner under successive Native Rulers
and dynasties, had to be investigated and revised. With this object in view,
surveys were made, and inquiries instituted into the rights of ownership and
occupancy, the result being that in many cases it was found that families
of position and influence had either appropriated the property of their
humbler neighbours, or evaded an assessment proportionate to the value of
their estates. Although these inquiries were carried out with the best intentions,
they were extremely distasteful to the higher classes, while they failed
to conciliate the masses. The ruling families deeply resented our endeavours
to introduce an equitable determination of rights and assessment of land
revenue.... On the other hand, although the agricultural population
greatly benefited by our rule, they could not realise the benevolent intentions
of a Government which tried to elevate their position and improve their
prospects&#8217; (<i>Forty One Years in India</i>, London, 1901, p. 233).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_359" id="Footnote_359" href="#FNanchor_359"><span class="label">[359]</span></a>In his <i>Maxims on Government</i> (translated from the Persian into English in
1783), Timur says: &#8216;And I commanded that they should build places of
worship, and monasteries in every city; and that they should erect structures
for the reception of travellers on the high roads, and that they should make
bridges across the rivers.</p>

<p>&#8216;And I commanded that the ruined bridges should be repaired; and that
bridges should be constructed over the rivulets, and over the rivers; and that
on the roads, at the distance of one stage from each other, Kauruwansarai
should be erected; and that guards and watchmen should be stationed on the
road, and that in every Kauruwansarai people should be appointed to
reside....</p>

<p>&#8216;And I ordained, whoever undertook the cultivation of waste lands, or
built an aqueduct, or made a canal, or planted a grove, or restored to
culture a deserted district, that in the first year nothing should be taken from
him, and that in the second year, whatever the subject voluntarily offered
should be received, and that in the third year, duties should be collected
according to the regulation&#8217; (James Mill, op. cit., vol. ii, pp. 493,
498).</p>

et les Coûtumes Kabyles</i>, vol. ii, 1873, &#8216;Droit Civil&#8217;, pp. 468-73). The authors,
by the way, appraised this impressive description of communism in the clan
with this peculiar sentence: &#8216;Within the industrious fold of the family
association, all are united in a common purpose, all work for the general
interest&mdash;but no one gives up his freedom or renounces his hereditary rights.
In no other nation does the organisation approach so closely to equality,

Reform of the &#8216;Indigenat&#8217; (Administrative Justice) in Algeria, stated in his
speech to the French Chamber of Deputies that thousands of Algerians were
migrating from the Setif district, and that 1,200 natives had emigrated from
Tlemcen during the last year, their destination being Syria. One immigrant
wrote from his new home: &#8216;I have now settled in Damascus and am perfectly
happy. There are many Algerians here in Syria who, like me, have
emigrated. The government has given us land and facilities to cultivate it.&#8217;
The Algerian government combats this exodus&mdash;by denying passports to
prospective emigrants. (Cf. <i>Journal Officiel</i>, June 21, 1912, pp. 1594 ff.)</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_368" id="Footnote_368" href="#FNanchor_368"><span class="label">[368]</span></a>77,379 chests were imported in 1854. Later, the imports somewhat
declined, owing to increased home production. Nevertheless, China remained
the chief buyer. India produced just under 6,400,000 tons of opium
in 1873/4, of which 6,100,000 tons were sold to the Chinese. To-day [1912]
India still exports 4,800,000 tons, value £7,500,000,000, almost exclusively
to China and the Malay Archipelago.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_371" id="Footnote_371" href="#FNanchor_371"><span class="label">[371]</span></a>An Imperial Edict issued on the third day of the eighth moon in the
tenth year of Hsien-Feng (6/9/1860) said amongst other things: &#8216;We have
never forbidden England and France to trade with China, and for long
years there has been peace between them and us. But three years ago the
English, for no good cause, invaded our city of Canton, and carried off our
officials into captivity. We refrained at that time from taking any retaliatory
measures, because we were compelled to recognise that the obstinacy of the
Viceroy Yeh had been in some measure a cause of the hostilities. Two years
ago, the barbarian Commander Elgin came north and we then commanded
the Viceroy of Chihli, T&#8217;an Ting-hsiang, to look into matters preparatory
to negotiations. But the barbarian took advantage of our unreadiness,
attacking the Taku forts and pressing on to Tientsin. Being anxious to spare
our people the horrors of war, we again refrained from retaliation and
ordered Kuei Liang to discuss terms of peace. Notwithstanding the outrageous
nature of the barbarians&#8217; demands we subsequently ordered Kuei
Liang to proceed to Shanghai in connection with the proposed Treaty of
Commerce and even permitted its ratification as earnest of our good faith.</p>

<p>&#8216;In spite of all this, the barbarian leader Bruce again displayed intractability
of the most unreasonable kind, and once more appeared off Taku
with a squadron of warships in the eighth Moon. Seng Ko Lin Ch&#8217;in thereupon
attacked him fiercely and compelled him to make a rapid retreat.
From all these facts it is clear that China has committed no breach of faith
and that the barbarians have been in the wrong. During the present year
the barbarian leaders Elgin and Gros have again appeared off our coasts,
but China, unwilling to resort to extreme measures, agreed to their landing
and permitted them to come to Peking for the ratification of the Treaty.</p>

<p>&#8216;Who could have believed that all this time the barbarians have been
darkly plotting, and that they had brought with them an army of soldiers
and artillery with which they attacked the Taku forts from the rear, and,
having driven out our forces, advanced upon Tientsin!&#8217; (I. O. Bland and
E. T. Blackhouse, <i>China under the Empress Dowager</i> (London, 1910), pp. 24-5.

<p><a name="Footnote_372" id="Footnote_372" href="#FNanchor_372"><span class="label">[372]</span></a>These European exploits to make China receptive to commodity exchange,
provide the setting for a charming episode of China&#8217;s internal
history: Straight from looting the Manchu Emperor&#8217;s Summer Palace, the
&#8216;Gordon of China&#8217; went on a campaign against the rebels of Taiping. In
1863 he even took over command of the Imperial fighting forces. In fact,
the suppression of the revolt was the work of the British army. But while a
considerable number of Europeans, among them a French admiral, gave
their lives to preserve China for the Manchu dynasty, the representatives of
European commerce were eagerly grasping this opportunity to make capital
out of these fights, supplying arms both to their own champions and to the
rebels who went to war against them. &#8216;Moreover, the worthy merchant was
tempted, by the opportunity for making some money, to supply both armies
with arms and munitions, and since the rebels had greater difficulties in
obtaining supplies than the Emperor&#8217;s men and were therefore compelled
and prepared to pay higher prices, they were given priority and could thus
resist not only the troops of their own government, but also those of England
and France&#8217; (M. v. Brandt, <i>33 Jahre in Ostasien, 1911, vol. iii, China</i>, p. 11).</p>

its 300,000 inhabitants. &#8216;Only a generation ago, the family&#8217;s shoes, hats,
shirts, etc., were made by the women themselves. At that time, it was practically
unheard-of for a young woman to buy from a merchant what she could
have made with the labour of her own hands&#8217; (Dr. Nyok-Ching Tsur, &#8216;Forms
of Industry in the Town of Ningpo&#8217; (<i>Die gewerblichen Betriebsformen der Stadt
Ningpo</i>), Tuebingen, 1909, p. 51).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_377" id="Footnote_377" href="#FNanchor_377"><span class="label">[377]</span></a>Admittedly, this relation is reversed in the last stages of the history of
peasant economy when capitalist production has made its full impact. Once
the small peasants are ruined, the entire work of farming frequently devolves
on the women, old people and children, while the men are made to work for
their living for capitalist entrepreneurs in the domestic industries or as
wage-slaves in the factories. A typical instance is the small peasant in
Wuerttemberg.</p>

immigrants was more than 400,000&mdash;138,000 of them British, and 134,000
American. According to a report from Montreal, the influx of American
farmers continued into the spring of the present year [1912].</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_395" id="Footnote_395" href="#FNanchor_395"><span class="label">[395]</span></a>&#8216;Travelling in the West of Canada, I have visited only one farm of less
than a thousand acres. According to the census of the Dominion of Canada,
in 1881, when the census was taken, no more than 9,077 farmers occupied
2,384,337 acres of land between them; accordingly, the share of an individual
(farmer) amounted to no less than 2,047 acres&mdash;in no state of the
Union is the average anywhere near that&#8217; (Sering, op. cit., p. 376). In
the early eighties, farming on a large scale was admittedly not very
widely spread in Canada. But already in 1887, Sering describes the &#8216;Bell
Farm&#8217;, owned by a limited company, which comprised no fewer than
56,700 acres, and was obviously modelled on the pattern of the Dalrymple
farm. In the eighties, Sering, who regarded the prospects of Canadian competition
with some scepticism, put the &#8216;fertile belt&#8217; of Western Canada at
three-fifths of the entire acreage of Germany, and estimated that actually
only 38,400,000 acres of this were arable land, and no more than 15,000,000
acres at best were prospective wheat land (Sering, op. cit., pp. 337-8). The
<i>Manitoba Free Press</i> in June 1912, worked out that in summer, 1912,
11,200,000 acres were sown with spring wheat in Canada, as against
19,200,000 acres under spring wheat in the United States. (Cf. <i>Berliner Tageblatt,

a feverish exchange of telegrams between Cairo, London and Leeds.&mdash;&#8220;When
can Fowler&#8217;s deliver 150 steam ploughs?&#8221;&mdash;Answer: &#8220;Working to

by spring 150 steam ploughs.&#8221;&mdash;A.: &#8220;Impossible.&#8221;&mdash;The works at
that time were barely big enough to turn out 3 steam ploughs per week.
N.B. a machine of this type costs £2,500 so that the order involved £m. 3·75.
Ismail Pasha&#8217;s next wire: &#8220;Quote cost immediate factory expansion. Viceroy
willing foot bill."&#8221;&mdash;You can imagine that Leeds made hay while the sun
shone. And in addition, other factories in England and France as well were
made to supply steam ploughs. The Alexandria warehouses, where goods
destined for the vice-regal estates were unloaded, were crammed to the roof
with boilers, wheels, drums, wire-rope and all sorts of chests and boxes. The
second-rate hostelries of Cairo swarmed with newly qualified steam ploughmen,
promoted in a hurry from anvil or share-plough, young hopefuls, fit for
anything and nothing, since every steam plough must be manned by at least
one expert pioneer of civilisation. Wagonloads of this assorted cargo were
sent into the interior, just so that the next ship could unload. You cannot
imagine in what condition they arrived at their destination, or rather anywhere
but their destination. Ten boilers were lying on the banks of the Nile,
and the machine to which they belonged was ten miles further. Here was a
little heap of wire-rope, but you had to travel another 20 hours to find the
appropriate pulleys. In one place an Englishman who was to set up the
machines squatted desolate and hungry on a pile of French crates, and in
another place his mate had taken to native liquor in his despair. Effendis and
Katibs, invoking the help of Allah, rushed to and fro between Siut and
Alexandria and compiled endless lists of items the names of which they did
not even know. And yet, in the end, some of this apparatus was set in
motion. In Upper Egypt, the ploughs belched steam&mdash;civilisation and progress

&#8216;consists wholly of taxes paid by the peasants in kind, and when one thinks of
the poverty-stricken, overdriven, under-paid fellaheen in their miserable
hovels, working late and early to fill the pockets of the creditors, the punctual
payment of the coupon ceases to be wholly a subject of gratification&#8217; (quoted
by Rothstein, op. cit., p. 49).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_409" id="Footnote_409" href="#FNanchor_409"><span class="label">[409]</span></a>Eyth, an outstanding exponent of capitalist civilisation in the primitive
countries, characteristically concludes his masterly sketch on Egypt, from
which we have taken the main data, with the following imperialist articles of
faith: &#8216;What we have learnt from the past also holds true for the future.
Europe must and will lay firm hands upon those countries which can no
longer keep up with modern conditions on their own, though this will not
be possible without all kinds of struggle, when the difference between right
and wrong will become blurred, when political and historical justice will
often enough mean disaster for millions and their salvation depend upon
what is politically wrong. All the world over, the strongest hand will make
an end to confusion, and so it will even on the banks of the Nile&#8217; (op. cit.,
p. 247). Rothstein has made it clear enough what kind of &#8216;order&#8217; the British
created &#8216;on the banks of the Nile&#8217;.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_410" id="Footnote_410" href="#FNanchor_410"><span class="label">[410]</span></a>Already in the early twenties of the last century, the Anglo-Indian
government commissioned Colonel Chesney to investigate the navigability
of the River Euphrates in order to establish the shortest possible connection
between the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf, resp. India. After detailed
preparations and a preliminary reconnaissance in winter 1831, the expedition
proper set out in 1835/7. In due course, British staff and officials investigated
and surveyed a wider area in Eastern Mesopotamia. These efforts
dragged on until 1866 without any useful results for the British government.
But at a later date Great Britain returned to the plan of connecting the
Mediterranean with India by way of the Gulf of Persia, though in a different
form, i.e. the Tigris railway project. In 1879, Cameron travelled through
Mesopotamia for the British government to study the lie of the land for the
projected railway (Max Freiherr v. Oppenheim, <i>Vom Mittelmeer zum Persischen
Golf durch den Hauran, die Syrische Wüste und Mesopotamien</i>, vol. ii,
pp. 5 and 36).</p>

assistant to Baron v. Hirsch was actively engaged in these transactions in
European Turkey, neatly accounts for the total grants towards railway-building
in Turkey which European capital wrested from the Turkish
government:</p>

<p>All this refers only to the period before 1899; not until that date were the
revenue grants paid in part. The tithes of no less than 28 out of the 74 <i>sandshaks</i>
in Asiatic Turkey had been pledged for the revenue grants, and with
these grants, between 1856 and 1900, a grand total of 1,576 miles of rails
had been laid down in Asiatic Turkey. Pressel, the expert, by the way gives
an instance of the underhand methods employed by the railway company
at Turkish expense; he states that under the 1893 agreement the Anatolian
company promised to run the railway to Baghdad via Angora, but later
decided that this plan of theirs would not work and, having qualified for the
guarantee, left the line to its fate and got busy with another route via
Konya. &#8216;No sooner have the companies succeeded in acquiring the Smyrna-Aydin-Diner
line, than they will demand the extension of this line to
Konya, and the moment these branch lines are completed, the companies
will move heaven and earth to force the goods traffic to use these new routes
for which there are no guarantees, and which, more important still, need
never share their takings, whereas the other lines must pay part of their
surplus to the government, once their gross revenue exceeds a certain
amount. In consequence, the government will gain nothing by the Aydin
line, and the companies will make millions. The government will foot the
bill for practically the entire revenue guarantee for the Kassaba-Angora
line, and can never hope to profit by its contracted 25 per cent share in the
surplus above £600 gross takings&#8217; (W. V. Pressel, <i>Les Chemins de Fer en
Turquie d&#8217;Asie</i> (Zurich, 1900), p. 7).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_415" id="Footnote_415" href="#FNanchor_415"><span class="label">[415]</span></a>&#8216;Incidentally, in this country everything is difficult and complicated. If
the government wishes to create a monopoly in cigarette paper or playing
cards, France and Austro-Hungary immediately are on the spot to veto the
project in the interest of their trade. If the issue is oil, Russia will raise
objections, and even the Powers who are least concerned will make their
agreement dependent on some other agreement. Turkey&#8217;s fate is that of
Sancho Panza and his dinner: as soon as the minister of finance wishes to do
anything, some diplomat gets up, interrupts him and throws a veto in his
teeth&#8217; (Moravitz, op. cit., p. 70).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_416" id="Footnote_416" href="#FNanchor_416"><span class="label">[416]</span></a>And not only in England. &#8216;Even in 1859, a pamphlet, ascribed to Diergardt
of Viersen, a factory owner, was disseminated all over Germany,
urging that country to make sure of the East-Asiatic markets in good time.
It advocated the display of military force as the only means for getting
commercial advantages from the Japanese and the Eastern Asiatic nations
in general. A German fleet, built with the people&#8217;s small savings, had been
a youthful dream, long since brought under the hammer by Hannibal
Fischer. Though Prussia had a few ships, her naval power was not impressive.
But in order to enter into commercial negotiations with Eastern Asia, it was
decided to equip a ship. Graf zu Eulenburg, one of the ablest and most
prudent Prussian statesmen, was appointed chief of this mission which also
had scientific objects. Under most difficult conditions he carried out his commission
with great skill, and though the plan for simultaneous negotiations
with the Hawaiian islands had to be given up, the mission was otherwise
successful. Though the Berlin press of that time knew better, declaring
whenever a new difficulty was reported, that it was only to be expected,
and denouncing all expenditure on naval demonstrations as a waste of the
taxpayers&#8217; money, the ministry of the new era remained steadfast, and the
harvest of success was reaped by the ministry that followed&#8217; (W. Lotz,
<i>Die Ideen der deutschen Handelspolitik</i>, p. 80).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_417" id="Footnote_417" href="#FNanchor_417"><span class="label">[417]</span></a>Following on the preliminary discussion between Michel Chevalier and
Richard Cobden on behalf of the French and English governments, &#8216;official
negotiations were shortly entered upon and were conducted with the greatest
secrecy. On January 1, 1860, Napoleon III announced his intentions in a
memorandum addressed to M. Fould, the Minister of State. This declaration
came like a bolt from the blue. After the events of the past year, the general
belief was that no attempt would be made to modify the tariff system
before 1861. Feelings ran high, but all the same the treaty was signed on
January 23&#8217; (Auguste Devers, <i>La politique commerciale de la France depuis 1860.
Schriften des Vereins für Sozialpolitik</i>, vol. 51, p. 136).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_418" id="Footnote_418" href="#FNanchor_418"><span class="label">[418]</span></a>Between 1857 and 1868, the revision along liberal lines of the Russian
tariffs and the ultimate writing-off of the insane system of <i>kantrin</i> with regard
to protective tariffs were a manifestation and corollary of the progressive
reforms which the disastrous Crimean wars had made inevitable. But the
reduction of customs duties reflected the concern of the landowning gentry
who, both as consumers of foreign goods and as producers of grain for export,
were interested in unrestricted commerce between Russia and Western
Europe. The champion of agrarian interests, the &#8216;Free Economic Association&#8217;
stated: &#8216;During the last sixty years, between 1822 and 1882, agriculture,
Russia&#8217;s largest producer, was brought to a precarious position owing to four
great setbacks. These could in every case be directly attributed to excessive
tariffs. On the other hand, the thirty-two years between 1845 and 1877
when tariffs were moderate went by without any such emergency, in spite
of three foreign wars and one civil war [meaning the Polish insurrection of
1863&mdash;<i>R. L.</i>], every one of which proved a greater or less strain on the
financial resources of the state&#8217; (<i>Memorandum of the Imperial Free Economic
Association on Revising Russian Tariffs</i> (St. Petersburg, 1890), p. 148). As late
as the nineties, then, the scientific spokesman of the Free Trade Movement,
the said &#8216;Free Economic Association&#8217;, had to agitate against protective
tariffs as a &#8216;contrivance to transplant&#8217; capitalist industry to Russia. In a
reactionary &#8216;populist&#8217; spirit, it denounced capitalism as a breeding ground
for the modern proletariat, &#8216;those masses of shiftless people without home or
property who have nothing to lose and have long been in ill repute&#8217; (p. 191).
This is proof enough that until most recent times the Russian champions of
Free Trade, or at least of moderate tariffs, did not to any appreciable extent
represent the interests of industrial capital. Cf. also K. Lodyshenski: <i>The
History of the Russian Tariffs</i> (St. Petersburg, 1886), pp. 239-58.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_419" id="Footnote_419" href="#FNanchor_419"><span class="label">[419]</span></a>This is also the opinion of F. Engels. In one of his letters to Nikolayon,
on June 18, 1892, he writes: &#8216;English authors, blinded by their patriotic
interests, completely fail to grasp why the whole world so stubbornly rejects
England&#8217;s example of free trade and adopts in its place the principle of
protective tariffs. Of course, they simply dare not admit even to themselves
that the system of protective tariffs, by now almost universal, is merely a
defensive measure against English free trade which was instrumental in perfecting
England&#8217;s industrial monopoly. Such a defence policy may be more
or less reasonable&mdash;in some cases it is downright stupid, as for instance in
Germany who under the system of free trade had become a great industrial
power and now imposes protective tariffs on agricultural products and raw
materials, thus increasing the cost of her industrial production. In my view
this universal reversion to protective tariffs is not a mere accident but the
reaction against England&#8217;s intolerable industrial monopoly. The form which
this reaction takes, as I said before, may be wrong, inadequate and even
worse, but its historical necessity seems to me quite clear and obvious&#8217;
(<i>Letters</i> of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels to Nikolayon (St. Petersburg,
1908), p. 71).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_420" id="Footnote_420" href="#FNanchor_420"><span class="label">[420]</span></a>Dr. Renner indeed makes this assumption the basis of his treatise on
taxation. &#8216;Every particle of value created in the course of one year is made
up of these four parts: profit, interest, rent, and wages; and annual taxation,
then, can only be levied upon these&#8217; (<i>Das arbeitende Volk und die Steuern</i>,
Vienna, 1909). Though Renner immediately goes on to mention peasants,
he cursorily dismisses them in a single sentence: &#8216;A peasant e.g. is simultaneously
entrepreneur, worker, and landowner, his agricultural proceeds yield
him wage, profit, and rent, <i>all in one</i>.&#8217; Obviously, it is an empty abstraction
to apply simultaneously all the categories of capitalist production to the
peasantry, to conceive of the peasant as entrepreneur, wage labourer and
landlord all in one person. If, like Renner, we want to put the peasant into a
single category, his peculiarity for economics lies in the very fact that he
belongs neither to the class of capitalist entrepreneurs nor to that of the wage
proletariat, that he is not a representative of capitalism at all but of simple
commodity production.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_421" id="Footnote_421" href="#FNanchor_421"><span class="label">[421]</span></a>It would go beyond the scope of the present treatise to deal with cartels
and trusts as specific phenomena of the imperialist phase. They are due to
the internal competitive struggle between individual capitalist groups for a
monopoly of the existing spheres for accumulation and for the distribution of
profits.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_422" id="Footnote_422" href="#FNanchor_422"><span class="label">[422]</span></a>In a reply to Vorontsov, Professor Manuilov, for example, wrote what
was then greatly praised by the Russian Marxists: &#8216;In this context, we must
distinguish strictly between a group of entrepreneurs producing weapons of
war and the capitalist class as a whole. For the manufacturers of guns, rifles
and other war materials, the existence of militarism is no doubt profitable
and indispensable. It is indeed quite possible that the abolition of the system
of armed peace would spell ruin for Krupp. The point at issue, however,
is not a special group of entrepreneurs but the capitalists as a class, capitalist
production as a whole.&#8217; In this connection, however, it should be noted that
&#8216;if the burden of taxation falls chiefly on the working population, every
increase of this burden diminishes the purchasing power of the population
and hence the demand for commodities&#8217;. This fact is taken as proof that
militarism, under the aspect of armament production, does indeed &#8216;enrich
one group of capitalists, but at the same time it injures all others, spelling
gain on the one hand but loss on the other&#8217; (<i>Vesnik Prava</i>, Journal of the
Law Society (St. Petersburg, 1890), no. 1, &#8216;Militarism and Capitalism&#8217;).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_423" id="Footnote_423" href="#FNanchor_423"><span class="label">[423]</span></a>Ultimately, the deterioration of the normal conditions under which
labour power is renewed will bring about a deterioration of labour itself, it
will diminish the average efficiency and productivity of labour, and thus
jeopardise the conditions for the production of surplus value. But capital
will not feel these results for a long time, and so they do not immediately
enter into its economic calculations, except in so far as they bring about more
drastic defensive measures of the wage labourers in general.</p>
